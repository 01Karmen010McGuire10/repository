<div class="rss-title"><a name="corporate" id="corporate"></a>DC-Corporate mailing list established</div>
<div class="rss-description">
<p>2002-12-23, Following discussions in the Corporate Track of the Florence conference, a mailing list has been established for people who have an interest in sharing and developing good practice in the adoption and deployment of Dublin Core to information services including traditional, web, and broadband publishing, as well as enterprise information applications including intranets, extranets, and Internet. An article by DCMI Board member Michael Crandall about the Corporate Circle initiative has been posted by the Montague Institute at <a href="http://www.montague.com/review/crandall3.shtml">http://www.montague.com/review/crandall3.shtml</a>.</p>
<p>DC-CORPORATE is a closed, unmoderated list for managers, developers and designers of corporate metadata systems and policies. The goal of this list is to put participants in closer touch with developments in the DCMI community that are particularly relevant to the corporate metadata milieu, thereby promoting metadata solutions that serve local corporate objectives while increasing the prospects for interoperable metadata that can be shared up and down supply chains.</p>
<p>Anyone can subscribe to the list (please send requests to the moderator: Joseph Busch [mailto: <a href="mailto:jbusch@taxonomystrategies.com">jbusch@taxonomystrategies.com</a>]). Only subscribers can post to the list.</p>

<div class="rss-description">
<p>2002-04-16, The DCMI-EU proposal has been evaluated by the Eurpoean Commission in the usual procedure with independent evaluators. We have now received the outcome of this evaluation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the evaluators have not given the proposal good marks so it is very likely that it will not recieve funding from the European Commission. The evaluators failed to see the benefits of creating a European forum for Dublin Core implementation issues.</p>
<p>As the proposal has attracted much interest in the DCMI community in Europe (with currently 90 organisations involved), a small group of people are now looking at how to build on the interest that was expressed. We will announce further news as soon as it becomes available.</p>

<div class="rss-description">
<p>2002-04-15, Authored by Erik Duval, Wayne Hodges, Stuart Sutton, and Stu Weibel, this paper emerged as part of a plan to bring the metadata efforts of DCMI and the IEEE LOM closer together. It reflects what some of the leaders of both groups feel to be common princples shared by our communities. We feel that these principles are likely to be common to other metadata communities as well, and that this paper will advance the common understandings necessary to improve adoption of useful metadata in many areas.</p>

<div class="rss-description">
<p>2002-03-06, On 28 February 2002, a proposal has been submitted to the European Commission's IST Programme for a Thematic Network called DCMI-EU.</p>
<p>This proposal aims to get European funding for the organisation of meetings related to the deployment of Dublin Core metadata in two areas:</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="rss-item">
<div class="rss-description"> 
Usage guidelines and best practice</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="rss-item">
<div class="rss-description">Architecture and infrastructure</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="rss-item">
<div class="rss-description">
<p>Three network meetings are foreseen over a period of 15 months. Additionally, the network would be involved in activities for promotion and publicity of DCMI activities in a European context. Part of the budget is assigned to travel support for network members to attend the meetings.</p>
<p>If the proposal is selected for funding, it will be easier for people to meet, share experience and discuss interoperable solutions in the context of the many Dublin Core implementation activities in Europe, at the same time helping progress of the global activities of DCMI.</p>
<p>The proposal consortium is led by PricewaterhouseCoopers, with three partners: Fraunhofer Gesellschaft in Germany, UKOLN in the UK and Giunti Interactive Labs in Italy. In addition to these four consortium partners, the initial network consists of 53 organisations from 20 countries; another 20 organisations have already expressed interest to become involved at a later stage. One of the members of the network is CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, that has offered to host the network meetings at their premises in Brussels.</p>
<p>The other members of the network represent a wide range of domains:</p>
