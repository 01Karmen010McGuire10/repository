<p>2002-04-29: The DCMI Directorate is pleased to announce that DC-2002 will take place October 13-17 in Florence, Italy. As with DC 2001 in Tokyo, we are planning a three track meeting: A workshop track A tutorial track A conference track The conference site will be the Convitto della Calza, an ancient convent of the 14th century, once a hospital for pilgrims, recently and completely restored. It is located in the historical centre of Florence, very close to the Pitti Palace and Ponte Vecchio, near the Porta Romana.</p>
<p>The Conference track will present papers in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>e-Government </li>
<li>Search engines and metadata </li>
<li>Educational metadata: improving communication </li>
<li>Knowledge management </li>
<li>Use of DC metadata for commerce and intranets </li>
<li>Semantic web: roles of standard cataloguing, indexing, metadata and ontologies </li>
<li>Metadata interoperability: tools and protocols </li>
<li>Cultural heritage metadata </li>
</ul>
<p>The Workshop track will feature technical meetings of ongoing working groups of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. The agenda for the workshop track is under development in DCMI Working Groups.</p>
<p>The Tutorial track provides structured learning activities designed to introduce participants to and guide them through selected topics of interest and importance to users, developers, and implementers of Dublin Core metadata. DC-2002 is organized by <a href="/">DCMI</a>, <a href="http://www.aib.it/">Associazione Italiana Biblioteche</a>, <a href="http://www.bncf.firenze.sbn.it/">Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze</a>, <a href="http://www.imss.firenze.it/">Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza</a>, <a href="http://www.iue.it/">Istituto Universitario Europeo</a>, <a href="http://www.regione.toscana.it/">Regione Toscana</a>, <a href="http://www.unifi.it/">Università di Firenze</a></p>
