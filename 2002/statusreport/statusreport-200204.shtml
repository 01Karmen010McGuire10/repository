      name="_Toc6743843">Introduction</a></h1>
  <p><span>This report on the status of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative covers 
    the activities that have taken place since DC-2001 in Tokyo, October 2001, 
    until end of March 2002. A progress report covering the results in the year 
    2001 and the workplan for 2002 has been published in DLib magazine ( <a
      href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february02/weibel/02weibel.html"> http://www.dlib.org/dlib/february02/weibel/02weibel.html</a>).</span></p>
  <p><span>The first part of the report describes the activities related to the 
    development of the new organizational structure for DCMI. The second part 
    of the report contains an overview of the work in the various working groups, 
    interest groups and committees in the reporting period.</span></p>
  <h1><a id="_Toc6743844"
      name="_Toc6743844"><span>Organizational developments</span></a></h1>
  <p><span>In January 2002, two major changes have occurred in the organizational 
    structure of DCMI: the installation of the Board of Trustees, and the establishment 
    of the Advisory Board that replaces the Advisory Committee. For more information 
    on these two Boards, see below in the section on Standing Committees.</span></p>
  <p><span>In February 2002, a group of European organizations submitted a proposal 
    for a Thematic Network to the European Commission, which aimed at obtaining 
    funding for a series of meetings of Dublin Core implementers in Europe. The 
    network, at the time of submission, included 57 organizations from a wide 
    range of domains (libraries, information services, governments, universities, 
    research institutes, commercial companies). Since the submission, another 
    27 organizations have expressed interest. Unfortunately, the evaluators of 
    the proposal had doubts about the benefits of creating a European forum, and 
    ranked the proposal low for funding by the European Commission.</span></p>

    been made of meetings, conferences, publications and projects. There have 
    been a number of discussions about specific aspects of the usage of the Dublin 
    Core Metadata Element Set and qualifiers. Areas of discussion included:</span></p>

    <p><span>A discussion on what should be at the end of a namespace URI was 
      continued after the Tokyo workshop. The outcome of the discussion was that 
      there could be either a human-readable document of a machine-readable schema, 
      although it was also argued that nothing is supposed to be at the namespace 
      URI.</span></p>
    <p><span>There has been a discussion on whether DCMI needs to consider changing 
      the HTML guidelines from recommending a notation with uppercase and dots 
      (e.g. DC.Creator) to a notation with lowercase and semicolons (e.g. dc:creator) 
      in line with XML practice. No such change is currently considered, to avoid 
      breaking existing implementations that follow the existing recommendations.</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="Section1"><span>A discussion took place on the exact content of 
    the schema for the Dublin Core, as it was identified that there are a number 
    of schemas on the DCMI Web site that are incorrect. Two task forces were established: 
    one for defining a correct schema for Dublin Core elements and qualifiers 
    in RDF/XML and one for doing this for pure XML.</span></div>
  <div class="Section1"><span>The XML schema for simple Dublin Core was finalized 
    in cooperation with OAI and will be made available on the DCMI Web site in 
    April 2002. Work continues on the XML schemas for qualified Dublin Core and

    <p><span>Discussion at DC9 in Tokyo identified the immediate work items for 
      this WG. These are: to propose a citation qualifier for dc:identifier; to 
      propose a means of encoding a journal article bibliographic citation record 
      within a parsable text string; to identify a list of standard identifiers 
      applicable to bibliographic citation; and to propose a means of encoding 
      a journal article bibliographic citation record in XML and RDF. Possible 
      items for later work have also been identified. A report of the Tokyo meeting 
      was posted in November 2001. <br />

    <p><span>The group discussed the status of its work on an education specific 
      resource type vocabulary, and decided to revive the work on the vocabulary 
      after it became clear that the Type WG had dropped its intentions to pursue 
      a DCT2 vocabulary and to rely instead on work by domain/practice communities. 
      The participants discussed the work done over the past year to determine 
      whether additional "Audience" element qualifiers might be justified and 
      decided to move this discussion to the DC-Education listserv.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> During the Workshop, there was an 
      interest group formed to explore the issues of accessibility in the larger 
      context of DCMI-based metadata. After a brief discussion of a very early 
      working draft of statements gleaned from a handful of education-based metadata 
      projects with regard to teaching processes and characteristics, the co-chairs 
      will continue the development of this draft document through discussions 
      on the listserv. The WG decided that there was a need for discussion this 
      coming year regarding the need to capture metadata statements dealing with 
      learning objectives that are local or intrinsic to a resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> 
      The focus of this new discussion is on objectives that may have nothing 
      to do with external criteria; they are purely local to the resource but 
      nevertheless useful for purposes of discovery.</span></p>

    <p><span>From discussion at the Type working group meeting at DC9 in Tokyo 
      and subsequent discussion on the email list, work items for this group have 
      been identified. A new charter, which reflects current work by the group, 
      has been agreed, and the WG's web page has been updated to include this 
      charter and indicate the new focus of the group.</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="Section1">
    <p><span>It was decided at the DC9 meeting that this group should no longer 
      attempt to develop a DCMI sub-type list (previously called DCT2) because 
      this is not a reasonable or attainable goal. Rather the task of the WG should 
      be to advise domain-specific groups on identifying their own lists of types 
      by developing best practice guidelines. An outline of a document 'Guidance 
      for Domains and Organisations Developing Type Vocabularies for use with 
      Dublin Core' has been produced.</span></p>
    <p><span>It was also agreed that the WG would no longer accumulate a list 
      of domain-specific type lists used within various projects because information 
      about projects using Dublin Core may be found elsewhere. The group agreed 
      to identify a list of standard type encoding schemes, and to possibly register 
      them with DCMI if appropriate. This list will be annotated with information, 
      such as who uses it and what are its strengths, to assist potential users 
      to identify an appropriate scheme.</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="Section1">
    <p><span>Discussion on the email list suggested that the WG should propose 
      the addition of a 'physical object' type to the DCMI Type Vocabulary encoding 
      scheme. There is currently no item on this list to indicate a physical object 
      type, a type that is needed in domains such as museums.</span></p>
    <p><span>It is hoped that volunteers from within the group will begin to write 
      the guidance information. WG members have been asked to supply suggested 
      type encoding schemes to begin the assembling of a list.</span></p>

      <p>T<span>he DCMI Board of Trustees was installed in January 2002. The nine 
        Board members, from six countries on four continents, have been recruited 
        to provide a combination of skills and geographic diversity appropriate 
        to strengthening the Initiative and broadening its reach.</span></p>

      <p><span>The Board will assist in strategic planning and provide guidance 
        as to choices concerning allocation of resources and the focus of the 
        Initiative as a whole; assist in the development of community support 
        that will increase the resources available to the Initiative through development 
        of sponsors, members, and targeted foundation support; and provide financial 
        oversight of the Initiative to assure that funds contributed are expended 
        efficiently and effectively in support of the mission and objectives.</span></p>
      <p><span>A conference call was held in late January 2002. The first face-to-face

    <p><span>The Advisory Board was installed in January 2002. It is</span> <span>comprised 
      of all chairs of DCMI Working Groups and Interest Groups and invited experts. 
      The Advisory Board gives advice to the DCMI Directorate on all technical 
      and strategic issues that occur during the operation of the DCMI. It has 
      a dual role in the DCMI: an internal role to assist in and advise on the 
      developments that take place within DCMI, and an external role to liaise 
      with the stakeholder community and other global metadata initiatives. It 
      has an important role in reviewing charters and activities of Working and 
      Interest Groups with specific emphasis on recognizing and signaling potential 
      conflicts between activities, suggesting specific coordination between Working 
      and Interest Groups, and proposing specific contacts with individuals, groups 
      or organizations outside the DCMI.</span></p>
