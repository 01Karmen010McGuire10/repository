Some references can be found at <a href='http://www.esmadrid.com/pm/PmRedirect?pmcodnav=ut11&amp;pmlang=en' title='Go to esmadrid.com web site'>esmadrid.com</a> (in English, Spanish and other languages) and <a href='http://www.descubremadrid.com/ext_bookings.asp' title='Go to Descubre Madrid web site'>Descubre Madrid</a> (in English and Spanish).</p><a name='currency'></a><h2>Currency</h2><p>Euro is the official currency in Spain, shared with other European Union countries. Paying with a different currency is not usually possible.</p><p>You can find the Euro exchange rates in <a href='http://fxtop.com/en/cnvhisto.php3?C1=EUR&amp;DD=&amp;MM=&amp;YYYY=' title='Go to Fxtop web site'>Fxtop</a> (with English, Spanish and ten other languages). These values may be very slightly different to the final exchange rates.</p><p>Wherever you go, you can find an ATM in Madrid. There are many bank offices (Banco Santander, BBVA, Caja Madrid, La Caixa, etc.) when you can use any kind of card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Diners Club, etc.). You can also use credit or debit card in most shops (this is usually indicated at the entrance) and on public transport, but not in buses or taxis.</p><p>There are also currency exchange offices in many places in the center of Madrid, and also in airports and train stations.</p><p>There is a bank office and 2 ATMs (from Banco Santander and Cajamadrid, 2 of the most important Spanish banks) in the University campus, next to DC-2005 headquarters. Both are situated in Betancourt building (50 metres from Padre Soler building). More banks and ATMs are situated within 300 metres of the University campus.</p><a name='language'></a><h2>Language</h2><p>Spanish is spoken in Madrid. English is only used in some shops and restaurants, although menus are shown in both languages in many places. English information is also available in the underground. Some department stores offer an English translation service for customers.</p><p>We have arranged a <a href='http://dc2005.uc3m.es/ti/glossary.asp' title='Go to glossary page'>brief English-Spanish glossary</a>. Moreover, you can use a larger <a href='http://spanishdict.com/index.cfm' title='Ir al sitio web de SpanishDICT'>English-Spanish dictionaries</a>, including pronunciation in both languages.</p><a name='health'></a><h2>Health and emergencies</h2><p>In emergency cases everyone can be treated in public health services in Madrid and the whole of Spain. Nevertheless, most of the foreigner visitors will need to pay for medical attention, so you are advised to purchase health insurance. Only EU visitors and residents in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Peru will not have to pay for health care in Spain, but only if they show the Health European System card (for EU visitors) or the corresponding certificate from your country of origin. <a href='http://www.spain.info/TourSpain/Informacion+practica/Consejos+Practicos/Salud+y+seguridad/Home?language=EN' title='Go to a page with more information about Health and emergencies'>More information on Health and emergencies</a>.</p><p>For emergency calls (police, fire, medical emergency, etc.), you can phone 112. In the city of Madrid, you can also call 092.</p><p>There are more than 20 hospitals in the region of Madrid. In Leganes, there is the Severo Ochoa Hospital. If you need it, you can go there by the underground (the trip takes 15 minutes from the University).</p><p>You can obtain medications at pharmacies. They are all marked with a green cross. In many cases, you will need a doctor's prescription in order to obtain medications. If you come from a country in the European Union, or your country has health agreements with Spain, you will have the same prescription drug benefits as Spanish citizens.</p><p>There are some <a href='http://www.descubremadrid.com/en/buscar.asp?tipo=100&amp;id=1200' title='Go to 24 hours pharmacies list'>24 hours pharmacies</a> in Madrid. There are also other extra pharmacies (called &quot;farmacias de guardia&quot;) in all districts of Madrid, at in many other towns. You can obtain a list of them (unfortunately, only in Spanish) at <a href='http://www.canaldefarmacia.com/menusoc.asp?pg=L3NvY2lhbC9mYXJtYWNpYXNfZ3VhcmRpYS9mYXJtYWNpYXNfZ3Vhcl9tYWQuYXNw' title='Go to Canal de Farmacia web site'>Canal de Farmacia</a>.</p><a name='weather'></a><h2>The Weather</h2><p>Madrid's weather in September is normallly warm, with a maximum of 30 ºC (86º F) and a minimum of 15 ºC (59º F). Rain is possible, but is not very usual. You can find weather forecasts for the next ten days in Madrid at <a href='http://www.weather.com/activities/travel/businesstraveler/weather/tenday.html?locid=SPXX0050&amp;from=36hr_topnav_business' title='Go to Weather.com web site'>Weather.com</a>, at the <a href='http://www.spain.info/TourSpain/Informacion+practica/Clima/El+tiempo+en+Espa%c3%b1a/0/5.htm?city=46?Language=en' title='Go to Spansih Tourism Office web site'>official Spain Tourism</a> website and at <a href='http://www.esmadrid.com' title='Go to Madrid Tourism Office web site'>Madrid Tourism Office</a> website.</p><a name='time'></a><h2>Time zone</h2><p>DST (Summer Time) is still used in Madrid in September, so the official time is GMT+2. For instance, at 12:00GMT, it will be 14:00 at Madrid. You can use <a href='http://www.timeticker.com' title='Go to Timeticker web site'>Timeticker</a> for discovering the difference between this time and your own place of origin.</p><a name='transport'></a><h2>Transportation</h2><p>Madrid has a great public transport network: buses, underground or railway from the city to the outskirts.</p><p><a href='http://www.metromadrid.es/default.asp?id=293' title='Go to Underground web site'>Underground</a> is the cheapest and fastest way of moving in the centre of Madrid. Underground network is extended all around the city center and also to many other places in the outskirts. You can even travel by underground from Madrid to Legan&eacute;s, host of the DC-2005.</p><p style='text-align:center;'><img src='http://dc2005.uc3m.es/_images/metro_train.gif' alt='Picture of a metro train' width='200px' height='98px'/></p><p>However, regional railway (<a href='http://www.ctm-madrid.es/servlet/PuntosServlet?xh_ACCION=24&amp;xh_TIPO=34&amp;CODPANTALLA=1&amp;CODBOTON=311' title='Go to Cercan&iacute;as Renfe web site'>Cercan&iacute;as Renfe</a>) is the best way for arriving there from the center or Madrid. From Atocha station, you will only need 20 minutes to get to Leganes station (it's only 5 minutes more to walk from there to <acronym title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</acronym>-2005). Railway is also useful for arriving to some interesting places around Madrid (see below <a href='http://dc2005.uc3m.es/ti/touristinformation.asp#outing' title='Go to Some suggestions for the week-end subsection'>&quot;Some suggestions for the weekend&quot;</a>).</p><p>A broad <a href='http://www.emtmadrid.es/index.html?lang=eng' title='Go to public bus network web site'>public bus network</a> is also useful for travelling inside Madrid, and many private but cheap buses allow travel to Madrid's outskirts. You can use the <a href='http://www.ctm-madrid.es/servlet/IdiomaServlet?xh_IDIOMA=2' title='Go to Transport Information System web site'>Transport Information System</a> to find more information.</p><p>There is also in Madrid a <a href='http://www.madridcard.com/en/AT.aspx' title='Go to Tourist Pass information web page'>Tourist Pass</a> (with information also in German and Italian) which allows a cheaper use of the whole public and private transport network. The Tourist Pass can be obtained for 1, 3, 5 or 7 days.</p><p>There are also taxis. (Official Madrid taxis are white cars with a red diagonal line on the door). The <a href='http://www.descubremadrid.com/en/result_trans_taxi.asp' title='Go to information about official fares web page'>official fares</a> are different at day, at night or at holidays and weekends. Only as a suggestion, a trip inside Madrid would cost between 2 and 8 euros; a taxi from city centre to DC-2005 would cost 12 euros, and a trip from Madrid airport to DC-2005 could cost around 25 euros.</p><a name='otherdata'></a><h2>Other useful information</h2><p><span class='cursiva'>Mobile phones</span>: you can use your mobile phone in Spain by roaming, but only if you mobile phone is GSM 900/1800 compatible. Most of the time, you don't have to change anything on your phone, although you should be careful with the roaming rates. You will be able to use one or more different Spanish mobile operators (Movistar, Vodafone o Amena): it will depend on your mobile operator in your country.</p><p>You can find more information at <a href='http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/cou_es.shtml' title='Go to GSM World web site'>GSM World</a> and also at this pages:</p><ul><li><a href='http://www.movistar.es/particulares/servicios/hablacualquierpais/ingles.htm' title='Go to Movistar web site'>Movistar</a>: (available in Spanish, English, French, German, Italian and Portuguese).</li><li><a href='http://www.vodafone.es/Vodafone/MultiIdioma/MultiIdiomaIngles/0,2626,8956,00.html' title='Go to Vodafone web site'>Vodafone</a>: (information is also available from http://www.vodafone.es in French, Italian, German and Portuguese).</li><li><a href='http://ingles.amena.com/amena/acerca_de_amena/cobertura/roaming_internacional/conectese_a_la_red_de_amena/index.html' title='Go to Amena web site'>Amena</a></li></ul><p><span class='cursiva'>Electricity</span>: voltage is the same all over Spain, 220 V / 50 Hz alternating current. Sockets are round 2 pin style, in line with European directives. It is important to take special care with appliances from the United States, since domestic use electricity there is usually 110 V and many devices do not come with a voltage adaptor. <a href='http://www.esmadrid.com/portalmadrid/imagen/i01062004095634.jpg' title='See an image of the correct socket'>See an image of the correct socket used in Spain</a>.</p><p><span class='cursiva'>Water</span>: Madrid water boasts exceptional quality: the water originates in the mountain range in the north of the province, from where it is deposited in reservoirs and then directly channelled to consumer points. This means the tap water neither smells nor tastes of chlorine. You can drink it without any problem.</p><p><span class='cursiva'>Internet</span>: direct Internet connection is possible in some Madrid hotels (specially, in 3 or more stars hotels). There are also many cybercafes all around Madrid, and some Wi-Fi points.</p><p><span class='cursiva'>Phone calls</span>: If you wish to call abroad from Spain, dial 00 + country code + the phone number. You can place international calls from a public phone. Phone booths use coins or cards, which can be purchased at tobacconists' shops (called estancos). If you wish to make a phone call within Spain, just dial the number with no prefixes. The phone number always has 9 digits, whether it is a cell phone or a regular phone.</p><a name='madrid'></a><h1>Sightseeing in and around Madrid</h1><a name='culture'></a><h2>Culture</h2><p>Between all its more than 20 museums, the best known in the world are the three included in the Paseo del Prado (also called &quot;Paseo del Arte&quot; or &quot;Art Avenue&quot;).
