<H1>About DC-2001</H1>

<P>
Providing machine-understandable data on the Web has become a priority
not just for publishers and scientific communities, but for a wide
range of commercial ventures and services.  Resource discovery across a
diversity of services on the emerging Semantic Web is facilitated by
the use of shared metadata vocabularies such as the Dublin Core
Metadata Element Set.
</P>

<P>
The Dublin Core workshop series has provided a forum for international,
cross-disciplinary metadata development since 1995.  DC-2001, ninth in
this series, will include an international conference for the broader
metadata community with three principal missions:

<UL>
<LI> to provide a forum to discuss further development of the Dublin Core
     and related metadata standards

<LI> to provide a forum to present and exchange new ideas about metadata 
     and applications, not limited to Dublin Core, and

<LI> to provide tutorials on the creation, management, and use of
     metadata applications.
</UL>
</P>

<P>
DC-2001 is the first event in the DC Workshop series to be hosted in
Asia and is also the first event to include conference and tutorial
tracks in addition to the workshop.
