       Andy has been involved with the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative one
way or another since 1996 - which basically means that he has done
his time and should be let out on parole! He developed the Web-based
metadata generator and editor, DC-dot, which has been widely used
internationally and the metadata help utility DC-assist.  He is a
member of the DCMI Advisory Board, the DCMI Usage Board, co-editor of
the "DCMI Namespace Policy" and co-author of the "Guidelines for
implementing Dublin Core in XML" proposed recommendation.  Andy is
an Assistant Director of UKOLN at the University of Bath, where the
bulk of his work is concerned with the specification and deployment
of distributed systems architectures supporting resource discovery.

       Eric Miller is the Activity Lead for the W3C World Wide Web
Consortium's Semantic Web Initiative.

Eric's responsibilities include the architectural and technical
leadership in the design and evolution of Semantic Web
infrastructure. Additional responsibilities include building support

among user and vendor communities for the Semantic Web by
illustrating the benefits to those communities and means of
participating in the creation of a metadata-ready Web. And finally
to establish liaisons with other technical standards bodies involved
in Web-related technology to ensure compliance with existing
Semantic Web standards and collect requirements for future W3C work.

Before joining the W3C, Eric was a Senior Research Scientist at OCLC
Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and the Associate Director of
the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.

Eric holds a Research Scientist appointment at MIT's Laboratory for
Computer Science.</font></li>

resource discovery and information architectures. She brings to this
role wide experience of the implementation and development of
information management systems in the commercial and library sectors.
She has a particular interest in schema registries and application
profiles which have been central to the SCHEMAS project, an activity
which is being taken forward within a new European project CORES.
Rachel has been active in the development of the Dublin Core, and
has given presentations at a number of DCMI international workshops
and meetings, she co-chairs the DCMI Registry Working Group, and is
a member of the Dublin Core Advisory Board.
