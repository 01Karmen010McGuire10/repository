<h3><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ottawa Tourism</font></h3>



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Canada's Capital: An Overview </font></h4>



Ottawa has been described as one of the most beautiful capitals in the world. Less than an hour's drive from the American border, Ottawa enjoys the attributes of a major centre for the visual and performing arts, as well as other big city attractions. Yet, it still maintains the accessibility, atmosphere and charm of a smaller city, in addition to access to spectacular park and wilderness areas located within and around the city. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting Around</font></h4>



Transportation within the city of Ottawa is excellent whether on foot, by <a href="http://216.58.40.3">bus</a>, bike or less conventional modes of transportation. The city's major advantage is that the downtown core is very compact and many of the sites and attractions are accessible on foot. Guided sightseeing tours, many of which operate on a schedule with flexible "on-off" privileges, allow visitors to stop and see the attractions of their choice. Sightseeing can be done via a walking tour, on an air-conditioned coach, a motorized trolley or on an authentic British double-decker bus. To experience the city up-close, visitors can <a href="http://www.cyberus.ca/~rentabike/">rent a bicycle</a> and pedal along Ottawa's designated bike lanes and scenic paths; or, pamper themselves and hire a rickshaw. Boat cruises along the Rideau Canal, Rideau River or Ottawa River are also a good way to see the sights. 

<p>

From May until October, train buffs can enjoy a half day trip along the beautiful Gatineau River on one of <a href=" http://www.steamtrain.ca">Canada's last authentic steam-powered trains</a>; the steam train is the only one of its kind still operating in eastern Canada. Ottawa also boasts one of the most modern <a href="http://216.58.40.3">public transit systems</a> in North America. As well, there are many taxi and car rental firms available to transport visitors around the town. For tourists in town and out using their own vehicles, they can relax - traffic in and around the capital is light and it's easy to get around. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Life in Canada's Capital</font></h4>



Ottawa lies within <a href="http://canada.gc.ca">Canada's Capital Region</a> which is an area comprising two provinces (Ontario and Quebec) and two main cities (Ottawa and Hull), creating a region much like Washington in the United States. The region comprises 27 municipalities (11 on the Ontario side) and covers an area of 4,662 square kilometres (1,800 square miles). 

<p>

As it is situated on the border of Quebec and Ontario, Ottawa has developed as the result of a blend of English and French cultures; almost half of the residents are bilingual. Added to this mix is a growing ethnic diversity inspired by the city's German, Lebanese, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Portuguese and Asian populations, among others. The result is a truly cosmopolitan city that celebrates its heritage in many colourful, multicultural festivals and events throughout the year. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Population</font></h4>



Canada's Capital Region is the fourth largest metropolitan area in Canada, with a population of just over one million people. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Economy</font></h4>



Because of its position as the capital of Canada and seat of the federal government, Ottawa has traditionally enjoyed a stable economy and measured growth. In turn, this has provided a supportive business environment for its commercial, industrial, retail, hospitality and government-related industries. However, over the years, the city's economy has diversified to include a thriving and dynamic community of private sector firms and over 1,000 national associations (an estimated 350 associations house their national headquarters in Ottawa). The region is also the headquarters of many national corporations, especially in the field of high technology. Already termed "Silicon Valley North," Ottawa is home to more than 800 companies specializing in high technology. Over 18,000 residents work in the health and life sciences fields, making the region a world leader in this area. Ottawa is also a centre for advanced research and development, especially in the fields of space science, telecommunications and environmental technology. Tourism also pays a significant role contributing an annual economic impact of $ 1.02 billion in 1997 for Canada's Capital Region. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Education</font></h4>



Ottawa has four publicly-funded school boards, a "public" and a "separate" (Roman Catholic), as well as other privately funded institutions. There are three universities in the area, <a href="http://www.carleton.ca">Carleton University</a>, the <a href="http://www.uottawa.ca">University of Ottawa</a> and <a href="http://www.uqah.uquebec.ca">Université de Québec à Hull</a> and two community colleges, <a href="http://www.algonquinc.on.ca">Algonquin College</a> and <a href="http://www.lacitec.on.ca">La Cité Collegiale</a>. Established in 1856, the <a href="http://www.uottawa.ca">University of Ottawa</a> is one of the oldest universities in Canada and is the largest bilingual institution in the country. "Ottawa U", as it is known locally, specializes in law and medicine. <a href="http://www.carleton.ca">Carleton University</a> is well-known for its faculties of journalism, architecture and public administration. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Communications</font></h4>



Ottawa serves as both a diplomatic and a business centre; therefore, its communications sector is well developed. As the nation's capital, there is representation from all major news outlets, either by correspondents or with a bureau. There is also a wide range of local, ethnic and special interest media to be found in the region. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shopping</font></h4>



Visitors who like to shop will find Ottawa is their kind of city. Whether they are looking for major department stores, discount warehouses or individual boutiques, Ottawa has them all. There are a number of interesting shopping areas which are perfect for outdoor strolling and feature a wide range of locally-crafted, original and antique merchandise. The Bank Street Promenade, the <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/ByWardMarket/">By Ward Market</a>, Rideau Street, the Glebe, <a href="http://www.restaurant.ca/ott/ottoeil_frm_en.shtml">Westboro Village</a> and the <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/SparksStreet/">Sparks Street Mall</a> (Canada's oldest pedestrian mall) are all areas where people can wander at ease or take a break at a speciality café or pub. 

<p>

The capital region is also home to 70 large shopping centres. The largest include the downtown Rideau Centre, Bayshore Shopping Centre to the west, and Place d'Orleans and St. Laurent Shopping Centre to the east. Some smaller shopping centres in the downtown core also offer an interesting mix of stores and services, including the World Exchange Plaza, Place du Centre in Hull, and 240 Sparks and Place De Ville in Ottawa. 

<p>

Not to be overlooked are the gift shops in any one of the capital's 12 national museums. They are a treasure trove of pure Canadiana, including jewellery, sculptures and glass, native art, models and scientific specimens, educational toys, cards, posters and books. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Entertainment</font></h4>



If it is entertainment visitors are looking for, the city has a variety of places to suit every taste. For those seeking dynamic entertainment, the <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/ByWardMarket/">By Ward Market</a> and Elgin Street are well-known for their night clubs, pubs, straight and gay bars, dance clubs, and live music halls. Night clubs are open until two in the morning. Ottawa has five theatres staging plays, musicals, operas and classical concerts for the culturally oriented. <a href="http://www.corelcentre.com">The Corel Centre</a>, an 18,500 seat sports and entertainment facility, offers <a href="http://www.ottawasenators.com">NHL hockey</a>, music's biggest stars, figure skating, family events and more. At the <a href="http://www.casinos-quebec.com/anglais/hull/">Casino de Hull</a>, a world-class gaming facility, visitors can try their luck at the 45 gaming tables and 1, 250 slot machines. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dining</font></h4>



Ottawa's status as an international capital and our ethnic diversity has created an exciting <a href="http://www.ottawadining.com">dining scene</a> in Ottawa. The city offers a plethora of excellent restaurants many of which are conveniently located in the downtown core - in the historic <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/ByWardMarket/">By Ward Market</a>, along Elgin Street, in "Chinatown" on Somerset Street West, and in "Little Italy" on Preston Street. Preston Street has received city approval for the semi-official name of "Corso Italia". From haute cuisine to the more contemporary and exotic ethnic foods, the region features a wonderful range of delicious fare. Food to suit just about any taste can be found - from African to Afghani, Canadian to French, German to Greek, from Lebanese to Mexican, Spanish to Sri Lankan, Thai to Turkish, vegetarian to Vietnamese and many others.

 

<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A City of Culture</font></h4>



From humble beginnings, Ottawa has evolved into <a href="http://www.occdsb.on.ca/%7Esel/cyberpal/culture.htm">Canada's cultural capital</a>. The most difficult problem visitors have when visiting Ottawa is choosing what to do first. There are over 50 galleries and theatres in the region, showcasing the best of Canadian and international art, theatre, music, and dance performances. The city's museums, heritage buildings, parks, and monuments paint an exciting picture of its colourful past, while also allowing a glimpse of its future. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Arts and Culture</font></h4>



<a href="http://national.gallery.ca">The National Gallery of Canada</a>, founded in 1880, is home to the world's largest collection of Canadian art (including major works by Inuit artists) as well as excellent European and American collections. 

<p>

<a href="http://www.nac-cna.ca">The National Arts Centre</a>, opened in 1969, is Canada's premier showcase for the performing arts. It features three stages, where visitors can enjoy the best of English and French theatre, dance - avant garde to classical, music, opera and variety performances year-round. Under the direction of the newly-appointed and world-renowned celebrated conductor, Pinchas Zucherman, the <a href="http://www.nac-cna.ca/ottawa_eng/onstage/orchestra/orchestra.html">National Arts Centre Orchestra</a> has gained a high international reputation, touring at home and abroad. 

<p>

Located in a heritage building which was once the county court house, <a href="http://www.artscourt.on.ca">Arts Court</a> is now a municipal centre for the visual and performing arts. Housed within Arts Court is the <a href="http://www.cyberus.ca/~oag/">Ottawa Art Gallery</a> which showcases local and Canadian artists and also has a rotating exhibition of Group of Seven works from their own fine collection. One of the groups within Arts Court is <a href="http://www.legroupe.org/">Le Groupe de la Place Royal Dance Lab</a>, the only dance lab dedicated to research and development in dance, which features a dance theatre, where the public can view new pieces choreographed by national and international artists year-round. <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/gallery/">The Carleton University Art Gallery</a>, on the campus of the university, had its official opening in September 1992. The gallery has developed a small but representational collection of Canadian and European art and presents a stimulating program of temporary exhibits in their recently renovated space. 

<p>

The <a href="http://www.gctc.ca">Great Canadian Theatre Company</a> highlights Canadian content in their production schedules, and the <a href="http://www.o-l-t.com">Ottawa Little Theatre</a> stages popular works performed by local amateur actors on a year around basis. During the summer months, the Odyssey Theatre presents professional outdoor theatre in the style of the Italian Comedia dell'Arte at Strathcona Park, one of the city's historic parks on the Rideau River. 

<p>

Ottawa's own Opera Lyra brings opera centre-stage with its performances at the National Arts Centre. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Museums</font></h4>



The capital region is home to 29 museums, including 12 national museums and institutions that appeal to all interests and age groups. Many of these attractions line <a href="http://www.capcan.ca/english/about/international/confederation.html">Confederation Boulevard</a>, "Canada's Discovery Route," which links Quebec and Ontario and is the site of a variety of events which animate the capital throughout the year. The architecture of Ottawa's museums, the copper roofs and the Gothic towers of Canada's national symbols will provide a long-remembered sight. 

<p>

Just steps from the <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/ByWardMarket/">By Ward Market</a>, the <a href="http://national.gallery.ca">National Gallery of Canada</a> is located in a beautiful structure of granite and glass which was designed by the celebrated architect, <a href="http://www.msafdie.com">Moshe Safdie</a>, and opened in 1988. (Since the completion of the gallery, Ottawa has become home to another Safdie design - the reworking of Ottawa's City Hall on Green Island.) 

<p>

Through its vast archaeological, ethnological, folkloric and historical collections, the <a href="http://www.civilization.ca">Canadian Museum of Civilization</a> traces Canada's development from the Vikings to the present day. Métis architect <a href="http://www.djcarchitect.com/">Douglas Cardinal</a> designed the building to represent the geological formation of Canada. Its location, on the Ottawa River, is one of the most spectacular in the region offering amazing views of Ottawa's skyline and river shores. As part of its permanent exhibits, the museum houses the recently-expanded Children's Museum, reputedly one of the largest in the world, and the new Postal Museum. It also contains the world's first combined <a href="http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/cmceng/cinepeng.html">IMAX/OMNIMAX</a> theatre; screenings in this theatre surround the audience and allow the viewer to feel the sensations of flying and movement as no other theatre can. 

<p>

The <a href="http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/cwmeng/cwmeng.htm">Canadian War Museum</a> houses the most comprehensive military collection in Canada, providing a chronicle of Canadian military activities over the past three centuries. The War Museum also holds the second largest publicly owned art collection in the country, with almost 11,000 works. Life-size displays of artifacts and an extensive collection of war medals are just a few of the museum's attractions. 

<p>

The recently opened <a href="http://www.diefenbunker.ca">Cold War Museum</a> gives visitors an understanding of the chilling fear of a nuclear attack that characterized the early days of the 1950's Cold War. Nicknamed the Diefenbunker - after Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker - it is a four-story deep, 100,000 square-foot bunker. Built underground, its purpose was to withstand a nuclear blast from close proximity and shelter members of the federal government. 

<p>

From large-scale models of sailing ships to giant steam engines, the <a href="http://www.science-tech.nmstc.ca">National Museum of Science and Technology</a> traces the history of transportation and provides fascinating "hands-on" exhibits, ranging from telecommunications to space travel. It also showcases Canada's remarkable contributions to scientific research and development, especially in the realms of telecommunications, space exploration and high technology. 

<p>

The <a href="http://www.nature.ca">Canadian Museum of Nature</a> with its five million specimens, including dinosaurs, exotic animals and precious gems, showcases natural history at its best. Six large exhibit halls plus audio-visual shows, lectures and a children's discovery area provide fascinating glimpses into the world around us. The museum is also home to the Viola MacMillan Mineral Gallery with its breathtaking mineral displays and authentic reconstructed gold mine. 

<p>

The <a href="http://www.aviation.nmstc.ca">National Aviation Museum</a> contains a world-class collection of 118 national and international antique aircraft, including the strikingly delicate Silver Dart - the first powered aircraft to fly in Canada back in 1909 - as well as other aviation-related exhibits. Many of the displays are unique to this particular museum. Exhibits provide a wonderful environment for children, and for the adventurous, flights in an open cockpit biplane provide a memorable and spectacular aerial view of the capital. 

<p>

Visitors interested in historical documents, literature, film and photographs can visit the <a href="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca">National Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.archives.ca">National Archives</a>. The library preserves and promotes Canada's published heritage, while the archives holds over 60 million manuscripts, and a million maps and drawings. 

<p>

Next to the library and archives is the <a href="http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca">Supreme Court</a>. Completed in 1946, it is home to Canada's highest court. 

<p>

The <a href="http://cmcp.gallery.ca">Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography</a>, sister museum to the National Gallery of Canada, is located in a reconstructed railway tunnel alongside the Rideau Canal locks and houses an impressive collection of over 158,000 photographs, focusing on the work of Canadian contemporary artists. 

<p>

Of interest to people of all ages is the <a href="http://www.rcmint.ca">Royal Canadian Mint</a>, where commemorative coins are minted for Canada and many other countries of the world. Canada's coin currency is now minted in Winnipeg but the mint in Ottawa has gained a world-wide reputation for producing high quality coins for numismatists. The Currency Museum, housed in the Bank of Canada building, traces the history of money over a period of 2,500 years. 

<p>

The <a href="http://skimuseum.ottawa.com">Canadian Ski Museum</a> and the Museum of Canadian Scouting will appeal to ski and scouting buffs and their families. 

<p>

At the foot of the Rideau locks, and in the oldest stone building in Ottawa, is the <a href="http://collections.ic.gc.ca/bytown/">Bytown Museum</a>, which explores local history. 

<p>

Interesting exhibits depicting the history of an Ottawa area family, are found at the Billings Estate, a restored 1827 pioneer homestead. Laurier House, the preserved home of two former prime ministers, Sir Wilfrid Laurier and William Lyon Mackenzie King, displays interesting insights into the political life of these two men and of the nation's capital as a political centre. 

<p>

In <a href="http://www.capcan.ca/gatineau/summer/english/tosee/mackenzie/">Gatineau Park</a>, just 15 minutes north of Ottawa, visitors will find the charming Mackenzie King Estate (Kingsmere), the summer home of Canada's 10th and longest-serving Prime Minister. The grounds contain a restored cottage, a collection of historical ruins, lovely gardens and a tea room. King bequeathed the estate to the Canadian people and visitors and locals alike have been the lucky beneficiaries; this is the perfect tranquil get-away for a summer's afternoon. 



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heritage Attractions</font></h4>



The heart of Ottawa and the Canadian government is <a href="http://parliamenthill.gc.ca/">Parliament Hill</a>. Built between 1859 and 1927 on a tree-covered promontory overlooking the Ottawa River, the Parliament Buildings are magnificent neo-Gothic (Centre Block) and Gothic structures with copper covered roofs. Visitors can tour the House of Commons, the Senate, and the Library of Parliament in the Centre Block. The best view of the region can be obtained from the observation deck of the Peace Tower. On the lawn facing the Centre Block is the Centennial Flame, lit in 1967 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Canadian Confederation. 

<p>

During the summer, <a href="http://parliamenthill.gc.ca/">Parliament Hill</a> hosts the daily Changing the Guard ceremony, a military tradition dating back to the 19th century. The biggest day of the year is July 1 when tens of thousands flood Parliament Hill and Confederation Boulevard for <a href="http://www.southam.com/nmc/ohcanada/news/origin.html">Canada Day</a> celebrations. Most summer evenings, "Reflections of Canada: A Symphony of Sound and Light", which vividly narrates the emotional story of the building of a nation, unfolds on the lawns in front of the Centre Block; the show is offered in both English and French. In the months of December and January, Parliament Hill, Confederation Boulevard and the downtown area are ablaze with a dazzling display of lights forming a symbolic link of similar Christmas Lights displays in other provincial and territorial capitals, as part of the National Capital Commission's "Christmas Lights Across Canada" program. 

<p>

A most popular and interesting place to visit in Ottawa is the historic <a href="http://www.ottawakiosk.com/ByWardMarket/">By Ward Market</a>. Established in 1826, the market is Canada's oldest, continuously-operating farmers' market. Today, it maintains its old-world charm with its cobbled courtyards and busy streets, but it has also become a bustling centre for shopping, restaurants and entertainment, offering cuisine from around the world, small boutiques and a variety of bars, cafés and night spots. The spring of 1998 saw the restoration of the ByWard Market Building, the original structure where farmers and loggers carried out their trade and socialize back in the 1800's. The building now houses speciality shops, delis, chic cafés, and crafters. 

<p>

The Rideau Canal, which winds its way 202 kilometres (125.5 miles) from Ottawa to Kingston, is one of the most popular attractions for residents and visitors alike. It is a system of natural lakes and rivers made navigable by locks, dams and canal cuts. 

<p>

Originally constructed for defence and trading purposes, the Canal is today used for leisure and pleasure. During the winter, the Ottawa portion of the canal is transformed into the world's longest (7.8 kilometre/4.5 mile) skating rink. During the summer, the canal provides a haven for hundreds of boating enthusiasts and, for those on shore, a constantly changing panorama of boats of all shapes, sizes and vintages. 

<p>

<a href="http://www.gg.ca/visitor_e.html">Rideau Hall</a>, originally built in 1838, is the official residence and workplace of Canada's Governor General. Set on 79 acres of beautifully landscaped grounds just minutes from downtown Ottawa, Rideau Hall is accessible to the public throughout the year. During the winter, Rideau Hall is open for guided tours (by reservation only) and public skating on the historic rink. Summertime visitors can enjoy the colourful Ceremonial Guard, guided tours of the historic residence, its grounds and gardens, and free outdoor concerts. The park-like setting is idyllic for picnics, and children will enjoy hands-on activities and guides in period costume. 

<p>

Ottawa is very much a city of monuments. All around the city sightseers will find fascinating memorials and historic statues. Visitors only have to stroll the grounds of Parliament Hill and Ottawa parks to view dozens of statues of historical figures and events in Canadian and world history. The National War Memorial, in the centre of Confederation Square, was first dedicated to the memory of war veterans in 1939. Opposite the National Gallery of Canada is the National Peacekeeping Monument, entitled "Reconciliation." Human Rights Monument is located near the headquarters of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton on Elgin Street. Near the Rideau Centre is the Terry Fox Memorial, a monument to the young one-legged Canadian hero who ran half way across Canada - raising millions of dollars for cancer research -- before succumbing to the disease himself. 

<p>

Many beautiful and architecturally-pleasing churches are found in Ottawa, the majority of which were built in the 19th century. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, founded in 1828 on Kent Street, is Ottawa's oldest Protestant church. The Cathedral Basilica of Notre Dame, erected in 1839 on Sussex Drive, has soaring twin spires and is one of the finest examples of painted and carved neo-Gothic interiors in Canada. Saint Patrick's Basilica on Kent Street at Nepean Street was founded in 1855 and is the oldest parish in Ottawa serving English-speaking Catholics; Saint Patrick's was elevated to Basilica status in 1995. Christ Church Cathedral, on Sparks Street, was founded in 1832 and is the capital's Anglican Cathedral. The city's First Baptist Church, on Laurier Street, was founded in 1857. These are just a few of the beautiful old heritage churches of Ottawa. Visitors are welcome at area churches, some of which provide tours or printed guides for interested guests.
