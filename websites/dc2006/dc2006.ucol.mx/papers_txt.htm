<p align="justify"><strong class="negro">OVERVIEW</strong>  <br />
&nbsp;One decade into its expansion, the World-Wide Web is reaching ever-broader circles of society, transforming how people learn about our rapidly-changing world.&nbsp; A window onto a wealth of cultural resources, the Web is emerging as the locus of our collective memory, with profound consequences for the future of &quot;cultural memory&quot; institutions.</p>
<p>Metadata based on standards such as Dublin Core are a key component in the construction of Web-based repositories and e-learning environments in institutions such as universities, museums, government agencies, and libraries.&nbsp; DC-2006 -- the sixth in a series of conferences previously held in Tokyo (2001), Florence (2002), Seattle (2003), Shanghai (2004), and Madrid (2005) -- will be held this year in Colima, Mexico, 3-6 October 2006.</p>
DC-2006 will cover a full range of topics related to standards and technologies for metadata.&nbsp; This year, the conference theme is &quot;Metadata for Knowledge and Learning&quot;.&nbsp; This theme promises to be of particular interest to several distinct communities of practice:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Users of metadata standards relevant to e-learning, notably Dublin Core and Learning Object Metadata (LOM).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creators of institutional repositories in cultural memory institutions such as universities, museums, and libraries, especially with regard to the &quot;open access&quot; movement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Builders of intranet repositories and training environments in corporations and government agencies. </p>
  </li>
  <li> Users of related knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, subject classifications, and corporate taxonomies. <br />
