LD4PE EXTENSION (Tom and Stuart)

* The LD4PE project has been extended for one year beyond November 2016.
  This does not mean additional funding, just time.  Our goal is to wrap 
  up the project in April 2017.

* The goal of the CompIndex Editorial Board until then is to test the 
  new Github-pull-request-driven with ASN-editor-frontend workflow being 
  put into place by Joseph Chapman.  It has been on Joseph's calendar for 
  awhile to get to this in the week of February 13.

* While we wait for this crucial piece to be put into place, this week's call
  will simply to pick up the threads from last Fall and Summer: to check some
  long-outstanding pull requests 

* The Competency Index has been published at 
  http://asn.desire2learn.com/resources/D2695955 and 
  http://explore.dublincore.net/explore-learning-resources-by-competency/comp-index/ .
  Note that the simple text file
  https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/CompIndex/CompIndex.txt is obsolete
  pending its replacement with a full RDF representation - for example, see
  https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/CompIndex/published/D2695955.ttl, 
  converted from
  http://asn.desire2learn.com/resources/D2695955_full.xml

COMPETENCY STYLE

* https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/ld4pe-competencies-baker.pdf
  Please read these guidelines, which I put together for a presentation at 
  DC-2016 in Copenhagen, with particular attention to slides 7 and 8.

* Slide 7 highlights the verbs used to describe a competency (or benchmark).
  Would it be helpful, for potential writers of new competencies, to limit the
  set of appropriate verbs (or at least strongly suggest them)?  If we do so,
  might we want to tweak the wording of a few existing competencies
  accordingly?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXISTING GITHUB PULL REQUESTS

* To test Joseph's new system (pull requests against an RDF representation of 
  the Competency Index), some long-outstanding pull requests could be replicated 
  in the new system (Tom is willing to cut-and-paste), decided, and committed.

* For Friday's call, Kai, Debbie, and Magnus should please revisit the pull 
  requests listed below and confirm that they should still be considered.
