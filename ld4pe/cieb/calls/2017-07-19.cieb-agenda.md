ASN, ASN Editor, Github backend (Tom and Stuart)

As discussed on the May 16 call [1], we could in principle enter changes to 
the Competency Index using the ASN editor [2].

If we do this _and_ we want to continue assigning ASN URIs to topics and
competencies, as for "Understands the RDF data model as a directed labeled
graph" [3], we would need to have an efficient and well-tested way to do 
the following: 

1. Discuss and decide on changes or additions in the form of pull requests on
   the Markdown representation of the Competency Index [4].
2. Using the ASN editor [2], manually enter any decided changes and save them
   to the JSON representation of the CI.
3. Have ASN (i.e., Joseph) pull the changes and use them to update the ASN
   representation of the CI [6].  In this process, the added competencies are
   assigned ASN URIs, so we would need to pull the enhanced Index back from 
   ASN before making further edits.

Alternative way to manage CI and its URIs (Tom)

In principle, we could replace the ASN URIs in the Competency Index 
with DCMI PURLs.  Then we could edit our own copy and generate our own
RDF representation.  For example, instead of re-generating the Markdown 
after editing the JSON with the ASN editor, we could edit the Markdown 
and generate a Turtle representation, which we could then serve at the 
CI URIs.  The files in question can be found at [7].

This would require a simple Python or Ruby script (similar to [8] but 
in reverse: from Markdown to Turtle instead of from JSON to Markdown).
Why not just edit the Turtle?  Because the Competency Index is ordered, 
and holding the canonical representation in RDF would sacrifice order, 
at any rate if the RDF is to remain readable and editable.

Pull requests

I have created new pull requests to the new Markdown representation of 
the Competency Index based on pull requests that you all made awhile ago 
and that we have not yet integrated:

* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/pull/1 (Tom) correcting various mistakes
* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/pull/3 (Kai)
* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/pull/5 (Debbie)
* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/pull/6 (Magnus)

Issues 

* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/issues/4 - need competencies about ShEx
* https://github.com/dcmi/ldci/issues/2 - competency style: always spell out acronyms?
