  schema:description "This tutorial briefly reviews RDF triples and their graphical nature. Explains how when uploading many RDF datasets using a tool such as Fuseki, they are merged into one default Graph. This also occurs when the FROM keyword is used to query multiple datasets, and determining provenance(where the data came from) is difficult. Using Named Graphs (which are actually URIs) can help to remedy this situation. This topic is continued in the next tutorial in the series."@en-US ;
