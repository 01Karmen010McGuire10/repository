  schema:description "This presentation includes an introduction to Linked Open Data, Linked Closed Data, and the 5 star scale promoted by Tim Berners-Lee. Also includes a step-by-step walk-through of a successful implementation. It aims to teach the viewer to learn how to think about Linked Data APIs in real world terms, and also how to sell it to an organization. A lot of good information, but presenter is wordy and takes a while to get to the point sometimes."@en-US ;
