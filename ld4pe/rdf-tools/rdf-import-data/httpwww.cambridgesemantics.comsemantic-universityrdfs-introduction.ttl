  schema:description "Topic: RDF Data Model; Competency: Distinguishes between data type properties and object properties; Competency: Understand and use RDFS in defining and interpreting RDF vocabularies; Competency: Understands the uses and roles of domain and ranges; Competency: Understands inferencing and the means by which it is achieved; Competency: Understands the distinction between a validating schema (e.g., .xsd) and an inferencing schema (e.g., .rdf, .owl) as well as the benefits and limitations of each. RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema) is the most basic schema language commonly used in the Semantic Web technology stack. It is lightweight and very easy to use and get started with. In fact, many of the most popular RDF vocabularies are written in basic RDFS. After completing this lesson, you will know: 1) RDFS Theory; 2) RDFS Examples; 3) RDFS Syntax Details; 4) RDFS Introspection."@en-US ;
