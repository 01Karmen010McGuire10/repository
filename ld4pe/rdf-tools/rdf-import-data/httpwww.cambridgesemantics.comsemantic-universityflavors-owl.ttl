  schema:description "Topic: RDF Data Model; Competency: Understands inferencing and the means by which it is achieved; Competency: Understands the distinction between a validating schema (e.g., .xsd) and an inferencing schema (e.g., .rdf, .owl) as well as the benefits and limitations of each; Topic: Reasoning over RDF; Competency: Understands how reasoning and data integration can be achieved by utilizing domain knowledge embodied in RDFS and OWL The previous module, OWL 101, gave an introduction to OWL at a high level. Confusingly, there is not just one OWL standard. Instead, there are different flavors of OWL-each a distinct subset of the full OWL standard-that are simpler and, in some cases, much more computationally efficient for reasoning than the full standard. Fortunately, regardless of which flavor you work with, they are all OWL (e.g. any ontology written using any subset of OWL features is still valid OWL and should be consumable by most OWL tools). This lesson will briefly look at those flavors (or more formally, profiles) and discuss when you might want to use one or the other. Note that this is a fairly technical lesson."@en-US ;
