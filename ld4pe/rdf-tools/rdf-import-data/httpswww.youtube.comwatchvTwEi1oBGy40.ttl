  schema:description "This presentation is based on a paper describing the use case at Oxford University Press of migrating XML content to Linked Data. It discusses the business drivers which the authors have identified and some of the issues that have arisen around modelling RDF from an XML base. It also discusses the advantages and limitations of schema.org markup relative to richer XML metadata, and describes an experimental system architecture combining stores for both XML documents and RDF triples."@en-US ;
