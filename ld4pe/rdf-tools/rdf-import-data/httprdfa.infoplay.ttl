  schema:description "RDFa Play is a real-time RDFa 1.1 editor, data visualizer and debugger. RDFa is a way of publishing Linked Data in HTML5 documents- it solves both the data silo-ing and data linking problem by helping you markup things like People, Places, Events, Recipes and Reviews. Search Engines and Web Services use this markup to generate better search listings and give you better visibility on the Web, so that people can find your website more easily."@en-US ;
