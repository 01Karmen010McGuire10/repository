  schema:description "Topic: RDF data model; Competency: Understands the distinction between the RDF data model and its various serializations; Competency: Understands and explains the differences and similarities between the RDF abstract data model and the XML and relational (Codd) abstract data models. RDF and XML both attempt to address the problem of enabling different programs and different computers to communicate effectively with each other. In its own way, each takes an important step towards a universal language for data. This similar goal of creating a means for any system to communicate with any other is the basis for the confusion."@en-US ;
