  schema:description "Two typical examples of large Linked Dataset are FreeBase, and DBPedia, both of which use the RDF format. Python offers a very powerful and easy to use library to work with Linked Data: rdflib. RDFLib is a lightweight and functionally complete RDF library, allowing applications to access, create and manage RDF graphs in a very Pythonic fashion. In this talk, a general overview of the main features provided by the rdflib package is presented. Several code examples are discussed, along with a case study concerning the analysis of a (semantic) social graph. This case study is focused on the integration between the networkx module and the rdflib library in order to crawl, access (via SPARQL), and analyze a Social Linked Data Graph represented using the FOAF (Friend of a Friend) schema. This talk is intended for an Novice level audience, assuming a good knowledge of the Python language."@en-US ;
