  schema:description "The course catalog describes this course as follows: ?Introduction to the problems and methods of organizing information, including information structures, knowledge schemas, data structures, terminological control, index language functions, and implications for searching.? To organize information is to describe, arrange, group and relate things, with the aim of helping people find, select and better understand those things. Organizers of information have developed various tools to achieve this: the structures, schemas, and languages referenced in the description above. The specific tools vary with the domain of application and technological change, but the basic principles underlying these tools remain the same. These principles are the focus of this course. While we will cover some specific implementations and technologies in order to illustrate these principals, the emphasis will be on conceptual understanding rather than mastery of specific tools."@en-US ;
