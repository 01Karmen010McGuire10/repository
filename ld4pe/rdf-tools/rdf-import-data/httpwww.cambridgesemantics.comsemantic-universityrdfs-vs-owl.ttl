  schema:description "Topic: RDF Data Model; Competency: Understands inferencing and the means by which it is achieved; Competency: Understands the distinction between a validating schema (e.g., .xsd) and an inferencing schema (e.g., .rdf, .owl) as well as the benefits and limitations of each; Topic Creating a domain model; Competency: Understands the domain being modeled; Competency; Creates a graphical representation of the domain entities and the relationships among them; Topic: Reasoning over RDF; Competency: Understands how reasoning and data integration can be achieved by utilizing domain knowledge embodied in RDFS and OWL. Previous modules introduced both RDFS and OWL as data modeling languages for describing RDF data. So which should you use? The quick answer is that although each has its place in the Semantic Web world, in general you should be using OWL. This article does a more thorough comparison of the two modeling languages."@en-US ;
