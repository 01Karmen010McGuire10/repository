  schema:description "Topic: RDF Data Model; Competency: Understands the uses and roles of domain and ranges; Competency: Understands inferencing and the means by which it is achieved; Competency: Understands the distinction between a validating schema (e.g., .xsd) and an inferencing schema (e.g., .rdf, .owl) as well as the benefits and limitations of each; Topic: Reasoning over RDF; Competency: Understands how reasoning and data integration can be achieved by utilizing domain knowledge embodied in RDFS and OWL. Topic: Creating a new RDF vocabularies; Competency: Understands the role of RDFS and uses it in defining new RDF vocabularies; Competency: Follows naming conventions in coining new terms (properties & classes); Competency: Creates new terms (properties & classes) following commonly agreed upon conventions and best practices. This guide describes an ontology-development methodology for declarative frame-based systems. It lists possible steps in the ontology-development process and addresses the complex issues of defining class hierarchies and properties of classes and instances. However, after following all the rules and suggestions, one of the most important things to remember is the following: there is no single correct ontology for any domain. Ontology design is a creative process and no two ontologies designed by different people would be the same. The potential applications of the ontology and the designers understanding and view of the domain will undoubtedly affect ontology design choices. Note: The creators of this guide used Protege-2000 as an ontology- developing environment for their examples, as well as the famous Wine Ontology."@en-US ;
