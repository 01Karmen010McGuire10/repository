What are the implications of knowledge organization systems and approaches? This class explores theoretical foundations, historical approaches, and current practices for organizing knowledge. The class will encompass a wide-range knowledge organization systems, from general terminological and classificatory schemes to domain specific semantic systems, including thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies.
