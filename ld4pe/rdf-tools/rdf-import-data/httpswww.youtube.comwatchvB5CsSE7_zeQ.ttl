  schema:description "This tutorial (the third of three) picks up where the first two in the series left off, covering the steps of setting up a Fuseki server to store data, interlinking that data with Silk, and then using Pubby to publish the data on the Web. Demonstrates how to connect entities by their URIs (not their labels) using sameAs. The tutorial ends by showing how SPARQL can be used to successfully query and filter the data which has just been published."@en-US ;
