  schema:description "The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) has become one of the sweet spots in the Linked Data ecosystem in recent years. Especially when semantic web technologies are being adapted for the requirements of enterprises or public administration, SKOS has played a most central role to create knowledge graphs. In this webinar, key people from the Semantic Web Company describe why controlled vocabularies based on SKOS play a central role in a linked data strategy, and how SKOS can be enriched by ontologies and linked data to further improve semantic information management."@en-US ;
