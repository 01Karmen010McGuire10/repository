  schema:description "Martin Malmsten is a developer/architect/technical lead at the National Library of Sweden. He works with many aspects of LIBRIS[1], the Swedish union catalog. He created the linked data interface to LIBRIS[2] to experiment with RDF (Resource Description Framework) and linking to other datasets. Malmsten is interested in how libraries continually re-link vast datasets. He believes that making information available to anyone is what libraries are about, and he supports linking to information using technologies created and used outside the library community. Miriam Safstrom is the metadata coordinator for the National Library of Sweden and works closely with Malmsten."@en-US ;
