## Draft Steering Committee Guidelines 

### Tasks of the Conference Steering Committee 

The Steering Committee is responsible for core planning for conferences added to the end of the 3-year planning window. For example:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2013-2014</td>
    <td>DC-2016</td>

  <tr>
    <td>2014-2015</td>

### Definitions 

- <u>Steering Committee on Conferences</u>: The standing committee for determining policy and operations for DCMI conferences and meetings (these guidelines).
- <u>Conference Committee</u>: The annual committee responsible for execution of a specific conference with membership comprised of a Conference Chair, Program Committee Chairs, Local Host Chairs and such other chairs as deemed necessary.
- <u>Exploratory Team</u>: Teams appointed to do preliminary investigations regarding host and venue for a specific, upcoming conference.

### Listing of Duties 

For each instance of the DCMI International Conference, the Steering Committee:

1. Selects the Conference Committee Chair-elect to 'shadow' the current Chair
2. With the Conference Committee Chair, selects the Program Committee Chairs
3. Approves the Special and Panel Session Chairs
4. Approves the DCMI Workshop Chairs
5. Approves such other chairs as may be determined from time to time
6. Reviews the theme of the conference
7. Discuses strategic conclusions to be drawn for future events
8. Appoints the next cycle Exploratory Team
9. Selects a Steering Committee Chair for the upcoming year
10. Coordinates, reviews and submits conference venue proposals to the DCMI Executive

### Working Format of the Steering Committee 

1. An online (phone/skype) conference session three (3) months prior to the upcoming conference to select the Chair-Elect for the following year (Task 1)
2. An online (phone/skype) conference session two (2) months before the conference to select and approve Program Committee, Special & Panel Session and DCMI Workshop Chairs (Tasks 2-5)
3. A face-to-face meeting at the conference to discuss and take actions (Tasks 6-10)
4. Such additional online (phone/skype) conference sessions as the Steering Committee Chairs deems necessary

### Members of the Steering Committee 

1. The Conference Committee chairs of each of the last four DCMI International Conference events
2. One Program Committee chair of each of the last four DCMI International Conference events
3. A member selected by the Oversight Committee at it's annual meeting
4. Such other members as may be determined from time to time
5. Invited guests to any Steering Committee meeting may include:
  - any of the current track chairs (e.g., Program, Special & Panel Events, and DCMI Workshop); and
  - any other persons at the discretion of the Steering Committee Chair

### Decision Procedure of the Steering Committee 

Decisions are taken based on the general consensus. In the absence of a clear consensus, a decision may be taken with a substantial majority of all votes that are not abstentions. Where a substantial number of Committee members appose an action, a consensus leading to action is not achieved.

The Chair of the Steering Committee:

1. Prepares and leads the agenda of the online conference meetings and the face-to-face meeting during the conference
2. Represents the Steering Committee with regards to external requests
3. Invites external experts to participate as guests in Steering Committee discussions
