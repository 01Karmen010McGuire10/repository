A **map** between two or more RDF vocabularies is a set of mappings between components of the vocabularies.

A **mapping** relates two components, each taken from a different vocabulary.

Each mapping is therefore a single RDF triple, with the subject a component from one vocabulary and the object a component of the other vocabulary.

For RDF value vocabularies, the components are usually SKOS **concepts**.

For RDF element set vocabularies, the components are **properties** or **classes**.
