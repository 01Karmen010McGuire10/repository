### Planning Grant Final Report Draft 

Grant no.: LG-51-11-0147-11

As proposed in the application under the IMLS program National Leadership Grants for Libraries, the Learning Linked Data project gathered instructors and practitioners to identify a set of instructional resources to support teachers of the principles and techniques of Linked Data. More than a dozen participants (listed in the Appendix to this document) convened February 2-3, 2012, at the Information School on the University of Washington campus. Prior to this meeting, participants collaborated via email listserv to compile draft lists of tools available for use in instructional settings and consider effective ways of documenting and packaging them to support effective teaching.

During the workshop, attendees proposed and revised alternative schemes of conceptual organization for Linked Data tools, while also adding new software applications and utilities to the list for consideration. The resulting scheme took the form of a list of learning topics (see the Appendix), each with exemplars of tools identified.

The discussion considered the need for and possible role of pedagogical structure and formatting for Linked Data instruction, ultimately determining that such detailed specification would be out of scope for the project. Such an undertaking would be complicated by the high variability of instructional goals, instructor inclinations, and objectives of possible Linked Data applications, so anything as specific as a sample syllabus would likely be modified so much that it would provide little value to educators. Instead, participants determined that the Learning Linked Data project should focus on compiling a pedagogically neutral inventory of instructional tools, with documentation to help instructors adapt the selected tools to their specific approaches.

Workshop discussions returned several times to consider potential contexts for instruction in Linked Data. Multiple use cases were mentioned, each highlighting specific aspects of the technology and processes for applying it. Time did not allow full explication of a representative set of use cases, so participants committed to developing and submitting draft scenarios for use in planning a later phase to implement the resource collection envisioned during the planning phase.

Following the February workshop, the inventory of learning topics was [posted online](http://lld.ischool.uw.edu/wp/) with an open invitation to comment and recommend modifications. Workshop participants committed to help spread this invitation within mailing lists and communities where they were active. A list of avenues for outreach appears in the Appendix. Participants also contacted colleagues directly to request review and comment. These efforts at outreach resulted in a strong list of suggestions for additions to the project's inventory of tools and learning topics, with discussion of real-life experience implementing Linked Data instruction. Most comments were documented as comments on the web pages linked above, but some arrived via email and other private channels; all were compiled and considered in developing an implementation plan.

The resulting plan will be articulated as a grant proposal to IMLS with a 2-year goal to develop an online "language lab" supporting instruction in the principles and practical requirements of developing Linked Data applications. The draft proposal will be completed by early September 2012 to allow review by workshop participants and maybe other stakeholders. The proposal will then be submitted to IMLS in January 2013, with implementation anticipated to begin the following October.

### Goals and Scope of the February 2012 Workshop 

The workshop set a goal of reaching agreement among participants on an analytical inventory of Learning Topics related to Linked Data. The inventory was intended to form an outline for a comprehensive collection of software tools to support the teaching and learning of the identified topics. Learning Topics and identified tools spanned the range of activities necessary to design and implement a Linked Data application.

The metaphor guiding development of this collection was that of a "language lab" for learning Linked Data. In this respect, the goal was to specify how the language lab should be equipped.

Participants came to the workshop discussions with backgrounds in academia and university-level teaching, IT development and deployment, software design, LIS, and metadata applications design. A first-draft inventory of Learning Topics was discussed point-by-point and refined into a second-draft and associated with supporting software tools.

The workshop began with a discussion of scope and objectives. The Learning Topics cover the basics of Linked Data to provide learners with a springboard both for learning more advanced topics and for applying skills in practice and to provide instructors with a well-organized and carefully documented collection of resources for supporting that learning.

The participants agreed to prioritize the analysis of existing Linked Data on the Web over the more ambitious goal of designing data models from scratch and creating Linked Data entirely new applications. In particular, the group considered the design workflow implied by the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core application profiles and determined that it is too specific to one methodology and may not suit all situations; for example, some students will be better prepared for UML or database approaches. Moreover, design of mixed-vocabulary profiles can quickly become quite complex. Given the state of known software tools, participants determined that a realistic approach would defer the requirements of application profile design to future projects.

Similarly, participants determined that specific learning outcomes and audiences were out of scope for the Learning Linked Data project. Its intention to provide broad support for learning and instruction might be too constrained if it were to detail specific skills or knowledge to be mastered by learners in specific courses. Each participant came to the workshop with particular pedagogical scenarios in mind – courses for particular learners, from particular backgrounds and experience (e.g., "baseline" versus "competent"), with particular expected outcomes – all of them together covered a range not easily stated in the same terms. Participants decided to focus on broad topic coverage rather than developing specific pedagogical approaches, curricular concepts, and target audiences, which would risk poorly serving other audiences. They agreed to take on separate tasks to articulate more specific use cases as follow-up to the workshop.

The discussion remained agnostic about how such a collection of software tools might be realized in a future project. Participants identified one option as packaging a set of tools (a "snapshot") for developing Linked Data applications, and another option might involve tightly integrating those tools in a common interface with "orchestrator" functionality. A third, simpler option would be to focus on documenting the potential uses of the tools in learning environments in a way that would fill the gap between how the software tools work individually and how each may support learning about Linked Data. The workshop agreed not to develop an integrated platform or promote a particular set of tools or vocabularies, but rather to collect a well-documented set of available tools that instructors could easily adapt, allowing them to focus on their teaching rather than hunting for resources.

### Discussion of Learning Topics 

The revised Inventory of Learning Topics emerged from extended discussion that resolved differences in opinions and practical perspectives. Participants acknowledged the "language" metaphor as particularly apt for instruction in RDF with useful emphasis on the nature of RDF as a conceptual model rather than just a specific data format or concrete syntax. However, a risk was apparent if upper-level headings for the Learning Topics were phrased in terms of the language metaphor (e.g., "grammar", "composition", "translation"...) because possible interpretations might conflict with general usage in writing about RDF. Participants agreed, therefore, that topic headings should use the native jargon of RDF.

The native jargon of RDF makes few distinctions between data types, rather "everything is just data." Distinctions common in other fields between, say, "element sets," "value vocabularies," and "datasets" are not native to RDF. Ontologies, RDF vocabularies, and SKOS concept schemes – the conceptual structures of Linked Data – are themselves considered as "just data" and expressed with the same formatting. Participants determined that the Inventory of Learning Topics, and any narrative about the future tool collection, should therefore take care to label topics primarily with terminology native to RDF, with references to corresponding terminology from other fields where explanation might be needed.

Cloaking the principles underlying RDF in the terminology of, say, library science, may help students in that discipline grasp concepts in the short term but will not prepare them well for working with RDF in the many other contexts where it is used. The participants felt that it is the job of instructors (not of the Learning Linked Data resources themselves) to shape the material into a form that specific groups of students will grasp. One participant noted, "Grounding it in RDF allows instructors to use whatever metaphor or mechanism makes sense to them and their students, whether linguistics, math, or programming logic."

Participants agreed that Visualization constituted a Learning Topic in itself, not just a type of tool. Visual node-and-arc diagrams, for example, are one of the modes in which RDF graphs can be expressed. Others are possible, and all together constitute an important topic of Linked Data instruction.

The workshop identified storing Linked Data as a subtopic to be included under the top-level topic Implementing a Linked Data application. Discussion recognized different types of storage in use, so instruction should acknowledge that data does not need to be stored in a triple store to be Linked Data. However, the tool collection should include triple stores, because that method of storing data is relatively easy and straightforward to implement. Participants wanted to distinguish between having a triple store in the tool platform versus triple stores as a Learning Topic {DT: Needs more explanation?}.

More general discussion of practical application determined that the project collection should specific Implementing a Linked Data Application as a top-level Learning Topic. Otherwise, instruction could risk leading learners to the edge then leaving them without the ability to actually put their knowledge into practice. This topic would cover "the actual things you might need to know in order to implement [Linked Data] in practice."

Any application should publish Linked Data "as Linked Data." In principle, Linked Data can identify an application only with non-dereferenceable URIs that do no more than uniquely identify the resources. Workshop participants agreed that the Learning Linked Data collection should address applications that make resources available at web URIs. "If you just took your data, put it into a ZIP file and put it out there, it's not Linked Data in the sense of being linked to anything."

### Use Cases 

Questions of implementation led to extended discussion of potential use cases to be fulfilled by Linked Data applications. Participants felt that selection of tools and documentation of their functions should reflect practical considerations likely to be encountered by learners in the application design process. Given the wide range of situations in which Linked Data technologies are suitable solutions, participants foresaw many different use cases.

- Merge MARC, EAD, and Dublin Core records into records in a university's proprietary "university core" format. The process involves extracting parts of five records in different formats to Linked Data triples, merging those into a graph, and turning that into a single record. 
- "A corporate problem would be that they can't efficiently get the data they need because it's dispersed in all these different places." The solution involves educating data managers to divert efforts from building and managing separate data repositories toward expressing all as Linked Data. This case emphasizes real-world education of IT professionals, library professionals, and others to think differently about familiar problems.
- A science association might have journals, conferences, committees, etc. on a topic. An article discovered on that topic might raise questions about other things in different formats or venues related to that article. The use case requires presenting links when a searcher finds the article leading to the upcoming conference, etc.
- A records management use case involved a large insurance company storing 2 terabytes of undifferentiated data at a cost of over $1 million per year. The use case involves a retention schedule for the data applied according to a controlled vocabulary via a crawling mechanism to every information object on the shared server. Legal holds on some data objects require their exclusion from those schedules.
- Three more use cases were added after the workshop during the public comment period.

### Associating Software Tools with Learning Topics 

The workshop concluded by determining, for each Learning Topic, what type of software tools instructors and learners would need to address that topic. Each functional type of software was illustrated, where possible, with a known exemplar. The resulting inventory of Learning Topics and supporting Software Tools provides the rough outline of a software tool collection needed by a "language lab" for learning Linked Data.

The collection of software tools is seen as providing a palette of functionality on which instructors can draw in realizing their own particular course concept. The metaphor of a "kitchen" was proposed, stating the challenge in terms of equipping a workspace with utensils that will allow cooks to prepare a wide range of "courses."

The original draft of the Inventory of Learning Topics proposed classifying topics into beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels. The workshop discussion came to identify a much more diverse range of backgrounds from which learners will approach the topics, leading participants away from making such distinctions specific to Learning Topics. The discussion of software tools, however, did recognize rough categories of complexity. Some are usable by anyone with a mouse and others require command-line input or writing lines of code with varying syntax. Participants accepted that the resource collection might need to distinguish tools by the levels of IT competence their use would require.

### Public Comment Period 

The inventory of Learning Topics was posted on a [public website](http://lld.ischool.uw.edu/wp/) to make the materials available for review and comment by a wider audience with interest and expertise in Linked Data. Workshop participants contacted individual colleagues and groups, including many relevant mailing lists identified in the list of Outreach Channels in the Appendix to this report. Over 50 comments accumulated on the public site, and many more were emailed to project participants by colleagues. All were logged in a set of mediawiki pages, which formed the basis for an implementation plan developed during the late summer of 2012 to be submitted to IMLS as a follow-on grant application to fund fulfillment of the promises articulated in the planning phase. {DT: Should we summarize key comments? The document is already at its maximum requested length, so any additions here should probably be offset by trimming earlier sections.}

Additional use cases also accumulated to augment those identified during the February workshop.

- Introductory university course in semantic metadata for advanced undergraduate informatics majors
- Museum staff interested in exposing collection descriptions as semantic metadata, probably mainly web developers or web producers, but maybe policy-level decision makers and primary collection managers
- Small academic research library wants to expose faculty names as linked data to incorporate into the institutional repository, researcher expertise/scholar profile applications (ex. VIVO, Community of Science), grant applications, publication tracking and metrics (esp. for institutional impact/sharing at the provost level).
