## Description of "Group" 

Groups are perhaps the most complex entities in DCMI and at the same time the least successfully served. Currently, they represent:

- domains of metadata interest and expertise (e.g., DC-Government, DC-Education; DC-Libraries), 
- functional areas that cut across the entire metadata ecology (e.g., DC-Tools and DC-Registries), and
- administrative bodies--e.g., DCMI's advisory and administrative groups. 

Frequently, groups are recursive in nature in that they can contain subgroups (e.g., "task groups") that need their own suite of all, or some subset, of the same functions as their parent). Since groups as a class can have sub-groups, the result can be a kind of Russian doll structure:

You'll see the term "bubble-up" used below. It means that the content "bubbles up" to parent levels. For example, a calendared event in a task group might bubble up to the calendar of its parent group; and, a community (group) announcement might bubble up to announcements at the top-level of DCMI.

## Categories of Group Activity

### _A. Communications and Social Networking_ 

Traditionally, the groups within DCMI have had listservs as their primary (only) means of public communication. The majority of these lists are through JISC while a few are lists maintained by DCMI through dublincore.org and dublincore.net (Google). It is thought that this listserv mechanisms (while of immense importance to DCMI's development), no longer serve many of the DCMI groups while somewhat better serving the communication needs of DCMI's advisory bodies in terms of announcements and limited discussion. DCMI has not directly ventured into integrating social media channels into its entity structures beyond maintaining a somewhat successful Twitter presence (and less successful LinkedIn presence).

1. Blogs
2. Forums
3. Open commenting

### _B. Domain Ecology Watch_ 

Groups vary considerably in their levels of activity. While activity of some is comparatively low, all communities (a group) are expected to perform the function of "community metadata watch" in their domain of interest. The goal of community watch is to provide a good, lively picture of activity across the domain of the community's interests without the pressure on moderators or community members to create original content. Thus, community watch might include (see also functions noted with "{\*}"):

1. Community feed aggregation;
2. Information submission using Drupal content types:
  - Calendar event submissions (what's happening around the world?);
  - Activity/project submissions (what's new, interesting projects out there?);
  - Tools & other useful community resources (including learning resources, publications);
  - Questions (community response & comment);
  - Glossary term submissions (community response & comment);
  - New initiatives happening around the world.

### _C. Committed Work_ 

In DCMI, committed work (i.e., work with an explicit agenda and more-or-less establish timeline, and more-or-less specific deliverables) are the function of task groups. Thus, when a metadata interest strand emerges in DCMI that frames some strategic objective or set of deliverables, a task group is formed to be responsible for governing the activity leading to reaching those objectives or completing the deliverables. Task Groups **can** exist as sub-group of one or more standing groups--e.g., a task group of the Architecture Forum and the DCMI-Registry Community.

1. Task Group Deliverables (Organized as Drupal 'Book _nodes?)_
  - 'Specifications'
  - Best practice documents
  - Documentation
  - Learning resources
