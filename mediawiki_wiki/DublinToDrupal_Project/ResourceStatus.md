## Resource Status Description 

Instances of the Formatted Specification content type have a lifecycle. A taxon from the Resource Status taxonomy is assigned to all given instances of the Formatted Specification content type to denote it's current placement in that lifecycle. Thus, taxons in this taxonomy range from the development phases of an instance through publication as an authoritative document to various stages of **decay** by being denoted as "archaic" and ultimately "deprecated". Some instances are "superseded" by newer versions of the content.

<u>These instances of the Formatted Specification content type never disappear</u>--they remain available for reference even after changes in status. A user decision to "use" the content of a Formatted Specification is dependent on the Resource Status of the instance. Since instances in development ("Draft") are generally open for comment by the group developing them, only instances designated "Private" are restricted to their authors.

**NOTE** : In creating new taxons denoting the lifecycle status of a document, never conflate aspects of the document's status with its genre or type. Thus, a proposed new taxon named "Draft Recommended Resource" would be inappropriate since it conflates the document status ("Draft") with the documents resource type or genre ("Recommended Resource"). Not conflating the notions of genre/type and status support more flexibility in constructing "views" of the content.

**NOTE** : ***A designation of Resource Status is required to "save" a Formatted Specification.***

</dt>
<dd> The Formatted Specification has been approved as an authoritative statement of its content.
</dd>
<dt> Superseded
</dt>
<dd> Some revision of the Formatted Specification exists that supersedes the content of the instance; or, some new specification supersedes the instance.
</dd>
<dt> Archaic
</dt>
<dd> Use of the content of the Formatted Specification is acceptable but not considered the latest, best statement of practice.
</dd>
<dt> Deprecated
</dt>
<dd> Use of the Formatted Specification content is not recommended; but doing so is not incorrect.
