## Description 

A number of content types in DCMI are created under the authority, or published under the authority, of different DCMI entities. For example, there is the content type of _Formatted Specification_. The highest level of publication of a Recommended Resource might be a specific community or DCMI itself. Taxons in the Authority taxonomy identify the highest level of authority for a document at any point in time. Thus, a specific Recommended resource might be published by a community (and be assigned the authority of _DCMI Community_ from the taxonomy) and later published as a Recommended Resource by DCMI at which point the Authority would be changed to _DCMI_).

## Taxonomy 

- DCMI
- DCMI Community
- DCMI Task Group
