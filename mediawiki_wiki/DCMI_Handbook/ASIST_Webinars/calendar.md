_Implementing Linked Data in Low-Resource Conditions_ (RESCHEDULED)

**Webinar Date:** Wednesday, 17 June 2015 9 September 2015, 10:00am-11:15am EDT (UTC 14:00) World Clock: [http://bit.ly/webinar-keiser](http://bit.ly/webinar-keiser))

**Abstract:** Opening up and linking data is becoming a priority for many data producers because of institutional requirements, or to consume data in newer applications, or simply to keep pace with current development. Since 2014, this priority has gaining momentum with the Global Open Data in Agriculture and Nutrition initiative (GODAN). However, typical small and medium-size institutions have to deal with constrained resources, which often hamper their possibilities for making their data publicly available. This webinar will be of interest to any institution seeking ways to publish and curate data in the Linked Data World.

Keizer and Caracciolo will provide an overview of bottlenecks that institutions typically face when entering the world of open and linked data, and will provide recommendations on how to proceed. They will also discuss the use of standard and linked vocabularies to produce linked data, especially in the area of agriculture. They will describe AGRISAs, a web-based resource linking agricultural datasets as an example of linked data application resulting from the collaboration of small institutions. They will also mention AgriDrupal, a Drupal distribution that supports the production and consumption of linked datasets.

      <strong>Johannes Keizer</strong><br>
      <p>Johannes Keizer has worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN since 1998, primarily as head of the FAO documentation group. The bibliographic database AGRIS and the multilingual concept scheme AGROVOC were completely remodeled under his leadership. In the Office of Knowledge Exchange, Research and Extensions, he heads a staff of 20—the AIMS (Agricultural Information Management Standards and Services) team—which provides standards, tools, and advice for FAO stakeholders. The AIMS Team provides the technical backbone for the global Coherence in Information for Agricultural Research for Development (CIARD) Initiative. Through EC framework projects such as NeON, D2Science, and agINFRA, the AIMS Team has channeled the results of innovative European research into the international work of FAO to combat hunger and poverty in the world.</p>
