## Presenter Selection & Agreement 

1. I have attached a letter of agreement which needs to be signed and returned, with bank information, so that payment can be made immediately after the webinar and in time for the end of our fiscal year. You had mentioned that we might be able to deposit the honorarium into a fund that might even be able to your travel to Lisbon, which would be great! Please just let us know the bank coordinates.

## Presenter Pre-Webinar Preparation 

1. Webinars in the NISO/DCMI Joint Series are customarily scheduled on Wednesdays at approximately 17:00 UTC.
2. The Thursday prior to the webinar, the presenter must have a draft of his or her Powerpoint slides ready to be submitted NISO for review and loading them into the webinar platform. If the PowerPoint slides are straightforward, this should be automatic, but if any of the slides have step-through animation, this might need to be broken down into separate slides.
3. It is not uncommon for presenters--even highly polished presenters--to have difficulty "connecting" with a remote audience in a webinar context. Here are several suggestions to help overcome the common sense of "awkwardness" felt by webinar presenters:
  - Present to someone -- either imaginary or real. The best way to avoid the awkwardness and feeling of isolation from the real audience with a webinar is to present to a single imaginary audience member or actually have someone in your office during the webinar and present to him or her.
  - The more you engaged in what you are saying to the audience, the better the pace of the webinar.
  - Avoid reading your slides -- it distances you from a conversational tone and is frequently very monotonous. Assume your audience can and will read your slides and wants to hear you flesh out the content.

## Presenter Technical Run-through 

1. The Thursday prior to the webinat, the presenter should have a draft of his or her Powerpoint slides that ready to be submitted NISO for review and loading them into the webinar platform. If the Powerpoint slides are straightforward, this should be automatic, but if any of the slides have step-through animation, this might need to be broken down into separate slides.
2. On the Monday prior to the webinar, a "dry-run" is scheduled with NISO lasting approximately half an hour. Usually, we try to schedule this for circa 17:00 UTC Eastern Time. The purpose of the dry-run is to: talk though and confirm: 
  - talk though how the webinar will proceed; 
  - talk though how questions from participants will be handled' 
  - confirm that the slides have converted correctly into the webinar format;
  - confirm that the presenter knows how to operate the webinar controls to advance slides, hand control back to NISO, etc. 
3. If the presenter has last-minute changes to the slides, they can be submit to Tom Baker and to NISO on the Monday before the webinar, or at the latest on Tuesday -- with the caveat that if the slides do not convert correctly, the fall back is to the previous, tested version.
4. On the day of the webinar, the presenter and all staff involved in the webinar meet online at least 30 minutes before the start of the webinar in order to test the audio and do a last-minute check of the webinar system. Assuming everything is in working order, we simply wait for the scheduled start time.
5. At the start of the webinar, there are brief introductions by NISO and by DCMI, then the presenter will speak from about about 5 minutes into the session until about 2:10 or 2:15, at which point, 15 to 20 minutes remain for questions.
