## DCMI Organizational Structure 
<dl><dd> DCMI is comprised of Boards, Standing Committees of the Boards, Communities, an Executive Committee, and a Directorate. Any of these entities (except for the Directorate) may create Task Groups for specific work items. Their roles are outlined in the <a href="http://dublincore.org/about/bylaws/index.shtml" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DCMI Bylaws</a> and defined in more detail in a <a href="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Handbook" title="DCMI Handbook">DCMI Handbook</a>. Changes in the organizational structure implemented in 2014 are discussed in a <a href="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/Exec_Committee/QA_struct" title="Exec Committee/QA struct">Restructuring FAQ</a>.

**Communities:**

<dl><dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<p>DCMI Communities are ongoing interest groups that bring together people interested in a specific topic related to Dublin Core metadata or metadata best practices in a particular domain. DCMI Communities are moderated by one or two moderators. They have a mailing list for discussion and exchange of information. Participation in a DCMI Community is open to anybody who subscribes to the open mailing list. Communities may from time to time create Task Groups with set timeframes and charges to accomplish well defined tasks such as development of draft Community Specifications.</p>  
</dd>
<dd>
<p>A listing of existing DCMI Communities can be found on the <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/#communities" class="external text" rel="nofollow">DCMI website</a>.</p>

**Task Groups:**

<dl><dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<p>DCMI Task Groups are established around a specific set of activities leading to a set of deliverables. Task groups are led by one or two Task Group leaders and consist of a group of people who commit to help perform the defined tasks. Task Groups may have a Web page, a Wiki and a mailing list. Anybody can ask to participate in a Task Group; the Task Group leaders are responsible for assigning tasks to the members. Task Groups are created by <u>either</u> a DCMI Community or Board to which the Task Groups' leaders systemically report on Task Group progress. Task Groups pursue DCMI endorsement of draft Community Specifications through submission to the <a href="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Technical_Board" title="DCMI Technical Board">Technical Board's</a> <a href="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Technical_Board/specifications" title="DCMI Technical Board/specifications">Community Specifications Committee</a>.</p>
