## Introduction
This document outlines the main responsibilities of the organization(s) (“Host”) hosting the annual International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata
Applications. DCMI's goal is to organize a conference that is economically sound, achieves its purposes without excessive or luxurious expense, and has as small an impact as possible on the environment. 

The DCMI International Conference is held annually for the purpose of:


**Providing tutorial opportunities for those seeking to learn more about DCMI, DCMI specifications, and current matters affecting the metadata ecosystem.**

**Providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and experience in the area of metadata design, implementation and best practices through peer-reviewed conference papers, invited talks, panels, posters, demonstrations, exhibits and seminars.**

**Providing an opportunity for people involved in DCMI Communities and Task Groups to meet face-to-face and discuss the activities of these groups, as well as providing opportunities to participants to come together to discuss issues of relevance to the deployment of Dublin Core metadata and more general issues affecting metadata best practices that are not already covered by DCMI groups.**

**Providing an opportunity for DCMI's advisory bodies to meet face-to-face to address both DCMI's statutory obligations as a company limited by guarantee under Singapore law and to engage in strategic planning.  These functions/activities substantially differentiate the DCMI international conference from those of other scholarly and practice communities.**

## Dates and Location
The DCMI International Conference (hereafter 'the Conference') and ancillary meetings take place on five (5) consecutive days (usually Tuesday and Saturday for ancillary meetings, Wednesday pre-conference for Tutorials and Thursday and Friday for the Conference proper and DCMI Community Workshop meetings) in the period from early September to late October, avoiding clashes with major events that could be relevant for the intended audience.

In particular, conflicts should be avoided with a spectrum of meetings with overlapping constituencies such as the US, European, and Asian digital library conferences, CNI, ASIS&T, and any other events that might detract from international, regional and local participation. As far as possible, conflict with major general, religious and local holidays needs to be avoided. The actual dates are set in consultation with the DCMI Advisory Board, taking into account
availability of staff and conference venue. Such consultation may not be possible where the decision is made to collocate the conference with an already-scheduled event.

## Size of DCMI Conferences

Given experiences with the Conference in the years 2001-2010, typical attendance of the Conference ranges from 150-200 (Shanghai 2004, Singapore 2007, Pittsburgh 2010) to 300-350 (Seattle 2003, Berlin 2008). Please note that during periods of regional or global economic difficulty, estimates of attendance should be suitable modest—the goal of the conference is to be excellent and not necessarily large.

In case of limited capacity, options for remote virtual participation—possibly fee-based—should be considered, taking into account whether an adequate remote participant experience can be guarantied. In all cases, DCMI encourages the “amplification” of the conference beyond the venue, particularly when doing so helps reach underserved metadata communities.
 
## Conference Tracks and Meetings

The event consists of three tracks:

* Tutorials. Formal tutorials presented by invited speakers. Tutorials are usually scheduled as fee-based pre-conference activities that can be attended without registration to the regular conference.
* Conference. Peer-reviewed papers in a traditional conference model, invited keynotes and special sessions on topics of interest to attendees. Conference only registration must be possible with addition registration for pre-conference activities (including tutorials) being optional.
* DCMI Community Workshops. Discussion and working meetings of DCMI groups are scheduled as part of the conference. Where appropriate, DCMI communities may propose special workshop sessions for offering during pre-conference. The Conference and DCMI Community Workshop tracks are combined in an interleaved way, with plenary Conference sessions (general presentations, keynotes and paper sessions) in the mornings and up to four parallel DCMI Community Workshop sessions in the afternoon. Depending on the need, approximately 15 slots of 1.5 to 2 hours each will be scheduled for DCMI Community Workshop meetings.

## Web Presence

DCMI owns and maintains it's own Global Conference and Meeting website at http://dcevents.dublincore.org/ that uses Public Knowledge Project's Open Conference System application (OCS). The OCS provides DCMI with the means for permanently maintaining access to assets of its regional and international meetings and conferences. The OCS provides the following functionality:

* Conference website
* Peer review system
* (Optional) Registration system with payment facilities through a PayPal plugin that can be linked directly to a Host bank account. The Host is responsible for providing any information in a timely manner related to the venue such as address and travel directions, and any suggested accommodation options. As part of its services, DCMI maintains the conference website and provides administrative access to the Chair of the Local Planning Committee (and others as required).

## Venue Requirements

The venue needs to be appropriate for the event, with one plenary room (theater style) for an audience of up to 300 people, and as many as 4-6 breakout rooms for around 30-50 people each. Plenary and breakout session rooms should be close together, with ample social interaction spaces to promote good interaction among participants. A space suitable for poster sessions is necessary, ideally accommodating reception catering in the same space to promote interaction at the poster session. The poster area must provide facilities to hang between 15-20 posters of ISO A0 size with adequate surrounding space for presenters and conference attendees.

The Conference Host must also provide meeting facilities fulfilling all technical requirements as defined above for ancillary DCMI administrative and advisory meetings:

* DCMI Oversight Committee: before the event, 10-15 persons; and
* DCMI Advisory Board: after the event, 30-40 persons.

Appropriate signage and other guides to the venue must be prepared and available for placement by the Host during the conference to identify particular sessions to conference participants.

## Technical and Audiovisual Services

Additional services at the conference venue are to include:


* Adequate, free and unrestricted and adequate wireless Internet access in all meeting rooms for conference participants;
* Wired Internet connections for presentation equipment;
* Audiovisual equipment and support, with a computer with Microsoft PowerPoint or OpenOffice Impress, a projector and screen per presentation and workshop room and sound amplification if necessary;
* Support presentation computers in meeting rooms to be patched into the room's audio system to support sound from remote presentations (e.g., Skype) to be channeled into the room sound system and for room microphones to be channeled through the computer to remote participants;

Any additional fees for the services enumerated above must be part of the initial conference budgeting.

## Proceedings Publication

The peer reviewed proceedings for the conference are permanently archived and available online and are published solely in digital form by DCMI. DCMI makes the proceedings available online at the opening of the conference. Also, the digital proceedings will be distributed to conference attendees on USB memory sticks. It is the responsibility of the Host to include local vendor arrangements for the manufacturing and loading of the USB sticks. The proceedings content will be provided to the vendor through the DCMI OCS system.

## Language

The language of all parts of the event is English. Simultaneous translation into the local language may be considered (sponsored by the Hosts of the meetings or by external sponsors).

## Cost

DCMI does not underwrite or provide direct financial support for the Conference. In lieu of direct financial support, DCMI's fiscal contribution consists of personnel, general management, website, optional registration/payment technical facilities through the OCS, long-term preservation of conference assets and other services necessary to the success of the conference. The conference host is entirely responsible for achieving a balance between cost and revenue. While most prior events have been successfully operated on a break-even basis by the Host, prepaid costs, deposits, and other advance expenses must be paid by the Host. Hosts are encouraged to structure financial arrangements to provide for adequate reserves and attendance contingencies. Insurance policies to cover any risks may be considered.

The following cost categories can be identified with details represented in the planning budget spreadsheet:


* Contribution to DCMI to compensate for resources provided in the organization of the Conference and the long-term maintenance of the Conference results based on the greater of: (1) 20% of total registration fee income, or (2) the total conference person-days multiplied by a base rate determined in consultation with the Host.
* Venue-related cost, such as rental of meeting space, wireless internet and presentation facilities as previously outlined;
* Staff-related cost, such as cost for people involved in the organization prior to the event, support staff during the event and interpreters;
* Catering during the event including coffee, refreshments and lunches for the delegates on all days of the event and welcome reception on Wednesday evening;
* Conference dinner, with option for delegate companions to participate for an additional fee;
* Printing costs including programs including the conference schedule, appropriate logistical signage guiding conference participants to session rooms, and attendee badges;
* Production of the electronic proceedings in the form of USB memory sticks for distribution to each attendee at registration;
* Registration fee waivers and support for travel and subsistence for DCMI Executive officers, keynote speakers, tutorial presenters and conference committee chairs, and when necessary for select expenses of DCMI Oversight Committee members to a total of an estimated US$20,000
* Economy class travel and three days of standard conference hotel accommodation for the Conference Committee Chair appointed by DCMI for a face-to-face meeting with the Host Committee and inspection of the venue.

## Revenue

These costs can be offset by:

* Reasonable conference fees
* Sponsorship by the Host or third parties, and any other source of income that respects the open and vendor-neutral philosophy of DCMI. DCMI has an ongoing program for solicitation of sponsors based on funding specific activities or resources that may be optionally used by the Host with solicitation through the OCS that targets smaller contributions but provides extensive sponsor coverage.

## Registration Fees

Registration fees must be set for full three-day participation and for single-day registration. The level of the Registration fee should be reasonable considering the audience but should also be sufficient to cover cost. Typically, registration fees are expected to lie within a range of US$200-275 per day, with discounts for multi-day, “early-bird” and student registration.

## Payment Facilities

The Host is responsible for providing online and on-site payment facilities for secure credit card payments, to be available at least 4-1/2 months before the start date of the event. Possibilities for payment by bank transfer and on-site cash payments may be considered. Optionally, DCMI's OCS system can accommodate online registration services with built-in support for PayPal (major credit cards and PayPal e-Checks) that can be directly linked to a Host bank account. Exercise of the DCMI PayPal option requires Host PayPal setup a minimum of 2-1/2 months in advance of the opening of registration. Onsite registration facilities at the time of the conference must be provided by the Host.

## Accommodation

The Host is responsible for providing suggestions for local accommodation in a range of price classes, ideally negotiating special rates for conference participants.

## Meals and Social Events

On all days during the event and the ancillary meetings coffee/snack breaks in morning and afternoon and lunch for registered participants must be provided.
Taking into account the international audience from various cultural backgrounds, meal arrangements need to cater for the provision of special meals (vegetarian, halal etc.).

## Committees

For the various aspects of the organization of the event, the following Committees will be
established:

Conference Committee:

* Chair appointed by DCMI
Responsible for the overall management of the planning and execution of the conferences
* Membership of the Conference Committee is comprised of the chairs of the subcommittees set out below

Conference Sub-Committees:

The Conference Committee should keep in close contact with at least one conference call (Skype) a month or more frequently as circumstances require. DCMI provides a list (with archive) for ongoing discussions of Conference Committee members at dc-conference@jiscmail.ac.uk.

## Conference Paper Review System and Electronic Publication

Peer review of submitted papers and posters for the event will be done through the OCS paper review system that DCMI will make available to the Program Chairs and reviewers. The accepted papers will be published first through the Open Conference System at http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2011 and then permanently archived in the DCMI Paper Repository at http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/.

## Timetable

A suitable timetable for announcements, calls for participation, paper submission dates, and other conference schedules will be developed by DCMI in consultation with the Host.

## Financial Planning & Accounting

To assist DCMI in appropriate planning for the current and future conferences, DCMI requires conference planning to be based on a mutually agreed upon set of income and expense categories. A detailed accounting of income and expenses must be shared between Host and DCMI from time-to-time during the conference planning process and at the close of the conference.


DCMI and the Host collaborate in preparing a tentative budget spreadsheet at the beginning of the planning process. Where possible, expenses in the preliminary budget spreadsheet shall be based on actual estimates solicited from potential vendors and other service providers in the area of the Host venue. The budget spreadsheet must provide for all requirements outlined in these Responsibilities & Guidelines .

The preliminary spreadsheet is mutually updated from time-to-time to account for unexpected income and expenses. Unexpected expense categories are added only with mutual agreement between the Host and DCMI.

At the close of the conference, the spreadsheet is updated to reflect actual conference income and expenses with a permanent copy placed in the DCMI archive for future reference and oversight.

In support of DCMI's commitment to organizational transparency, it is necessary that the financial details of its conferences be shared in confidence with the Initiatives advisory and administrative bodies and that summative financial data regarding the conference be shared publicly through DCMI's public annual report.

## Other Issues

Any other issue not covered in these guidelines should be addressed in consultation between the Host and DCMI.
