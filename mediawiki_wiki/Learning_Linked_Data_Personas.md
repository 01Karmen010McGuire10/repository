Defining "personas" -- typical users of the Linked Data learning platform -- will help us to design tools and approaches.

### Who are the learners? ("Personas") 

Potential audiences of the Linked Data learning platform:

- Faculty in higher education, especially information schools (Tom)
  - faculty with background in knowledge organization
  - faculty with background in computing (databases, Web site design)
- Librarians and catalogers (Marcia)
  - librarians/catalogers who hate or are afraid of changes happening in the areas related to their daily practices
  - librarians/catalogers who are excited about linked data
  - faculty members who have taught traditional cataloging for 20+ years, do not like 'metadata', are afraid of RDA, have never heard about Linked data.
  - faculty members who might be put on teaching metadata for two or three years now, may have better ideas about metadata, but know very little about Linked Data.
  - faculty members who have done research and teaching on the Semantic Web topics...
- People outside the academy (Joseph), e.g.:
  - business people
  - regular citizens
  - parents
  - children and youth
  - K-12 teachers
  - policy makers
  - the media, etc
- Students (Craig)
  - Entry-level students with limited or no exposure to metadata, linked data, web internals, data modeling, etc.
  - Students and practitioners with traditional cataloging training
  - Students and practitioners with organization/metadata training
  - Students and practitioners with database, IR, systems analysis training
  - Programmers and informaticists
  - The HIVE workshop attendees titles may provide some additional personas: broadcast librarian, metadata consultant/taxonomist, subject policy specialist, programmer/analyst, informatics analyst, content services librarian, cataloging coordinator,

#### Discussion 

- kcoyle: One big assumption seems to be that development of library systems takes place in libraries. Most development takes place in vendor offices. A few libraries are able to build tools (mainly university libraries). Those tools can be stand-alone, like D-Space, or they are built on top of vendor systems, like the original SFX. See [post](http://go-to-hellman.blogspot.com/2011/02/why-code4-libraries-exist.html) by Eric Hellman on numbers of developers in libraries. My question is whether we should target developers alone or include thought leaders and managers who can make decisions about the technology direction the library takes. 
- kcoyle: Marcia includes catalogers, and we need to decide if they are included. (And if so, I would expand that to all library staff.)
- Diane: Marcia's 'faculty' members' really belong under the first category, first group. The remainder might better be called 'Practitioners' and include, as Karen notes, all kinds of library staff. In particular, we don't want to leave out the people who work in libraries maintaining ILS software and developing applications. We can't assume that those folks don't need this kind of training.
- Diane: I'm uncomfortable about having separate categories for librarians/catalogers who are pro or con LOD (or change). My experience teaching practitioners is that most of the fear we see is because they are [1] afraid for their jobs and livelihood, or [2] concerned that they won't be able to learn this, or ever again feel competent. In my view, their attitude is primarily relevant to their supervisors or institutions--we are better off with an assumption that all are interested in learning, though their needs may be different.
- Ed: I agree with kcoyle, practically I think we need a persona category for managers. Lumping "policy makers" in with "children" seems to do a disservice to both&nbsp;:-) There are a lot of important policy issues around Linked (Open) Data that needs addressing in a learning environment, and I think it's more a socio-economic-political space than it is technical. But perhaps these sorts of issues don't fit the scope of the grant?
