# What is DCMI? 

DCMI is a not-for-profit organization committed to the development and open availability of resources that support a healthy global metadata ecology. DCMI advances this commitment through its support of innovation in metadata design and best practices for the global metadata community. Through the efforts of a broad community of volunteer metadata experts that make up DCMI, the work of the Initiative includes:

- Managing ongoing discussion of current DCMI-wide 'work themes';
- Setting up and managing international and regional events (using open source applications ( [OCS](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/) and [OJS](http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/));
- Curation and open availability of the meeting assets including proceedings, project reports and meeting minutes ( [OCS](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/) and [OJS](http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/));
- Creation and delivery of training resources in metadata best practices including tutorials, webinars and workshops;
- Managing long term curation of DCMI specifications and metadata terms namespaces; and
- Coordinating the global community of DCMI volunteers.

# _DCMI Community Forum_ Website 

The goals and character of the Drupal website under design for DCMI differ substantially from those of the current public website at [http://dublincore.org](http://dublincore.org). The current public website is a static, centrally controlled, html-page-based document repository with no direct support for the various groups that make up DCMI. This html-page-based website is hosted by the National Library of Korea. The infrastructure consists of: (1) an SVN repository consisting of various projects that drive the website and serve archival purposes; (2) a staging server where edits made to html, plain text (used in server-side includes), and RSS 1.0 files in the SVN are committed on an hourly basis; and (3) the public website updated from the staging server on request. While leads of communities and task groups can be granted permission to edit SVN files, such permissions are SVN-wide and therefore dangerous. As a result, 99.99 percent of all changes to the website are made by two members of the executive team.

The only support provided DCMI groups on the current website is: (1) an html index page [listing the groups](http://dublincore.org/groups/#communities); and (2) a largely unmaintained set of static pages describing each of the groupsâ€”e.g., a page for the [DC-Libraries Community](http://dublincore.org/groups/libraries/).

As a partial result of the centrally controlled, static nature of the current website, community work has used wikis -- first MoinMoin and now MediaWiki -- to get collaborative group work accomplished. The original intention was that information, once stable and needing wider public exposure, would move from the wikis to the website. This intention to migrate information has been largely <u>unfulfilled</u> resulting in the external appearance of community inactivity. The only communications mechanisms for groups in DCMI other than skype and conference calls has been an array of listservs provided by JISC<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup> in the UK.

The goal of the new ***Community Forum*** website is to support DCMI as a <u>continuously evolving</u>, continuously interacting aggregation of groups (communities, task groups, boards, committees, directorate). Each of these groups engages in a set of activities that are <u>totally unsupported</u> by the current website. In this wiki documentation of the new Drupal site, we will call the current website the "<u>document repository</u>" and the new Drupal site the "<u>community forum</u>".

The group activities to be supported in the community forum are illustrated in the following diagram:

[<img alt="DCMI Entity-Activity Diagram" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Entity_Structure.jpg" width="500" height="323">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Entity_Structure.jpg "DCMI Entity-Activity Diagram")

Some DCMI groups are of long, active duration (e.g., communities). Others groups have well-defined life spans (e.g., task groups) and ceased being active (but do not vanish) when particular articulated tasks are complete.

The only direct relationship between DCMI's current static document repository website and the activity of groups to be enabled in the new Drupal site is that the current repository's documents were authored by various groups. This relationship between generated assets (e.g., documents etc.) and the DCMI groups that generate those assets <u>is not apparent</u> on the current website.

The goal of the new community forum is <u>not</u> to blindly migrate [all of the content](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/DublinToDrupal_Project/Pages_to_Migrate "DublinToDrupal Project/Pages to Migrate") from the current document repository. Instead, we will be selectively moving key content to the community forum by tying that content to the authoring groups based on importance and need. It is likely that archival documents <u>may</u> remain on the document repository site and be referenced from the community forum. Decisions on which resources get moved from the document repository to the community forum will likely be an evolving proposition over the next 18 months to 2 year. New assets (documents etc.) going forward will be generated through the new community forum website using well-defined content types (see the Work Activity functionality in the image above and described below).

## Categories of Group Activity ('A', 'B', & 'C') 

### A. Communications and Social Networking 

Traditionally, the groups within DCMI have had listservs as their primary (only) means of public communication. The majority of these lists are through JISC while a few are lists maintained by DCMI through dublincore.org and dublincore.net (Google). It is thought that this listserv mechanisms (while of immense importance to DCMI's development), no longer serve many of the DCMI groups while somewhat better serving the communication needs of DCMI's advisory bodies in terms of announcements and limited discussion. DCMI has not directly ventured into integrating social media channels into its entity structures beyond maintaining a somewhat successful Twitter presence (and less successful LinkedIn presence).

1. Blogs
2. Forums
3. Open commenting

[<img alt="Community Activity Illustration" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Communicate_Activity.jpg" width="500" height="357">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Communicate_Activity.jpg "Community Activity Illustration")

### B. Domain Ecology Watch 

Groups vary considerably in their levels of activity. While activity of some is comparatively low, all communities (a group) are expected to perform the function of "community metadata watch" in their domain of interest. The goal of community watch is to provide a good, lively picture of activity across the domain of the community's interests without the pressure on moderators or community members to create original content. Thus, community watch might include:

1. Community feed aggregation;
2. Information submission using Drupal content types:
  - Calendar event submissions (what's happening around the world?);
  - Activity/project submissions (what's new, interesting projects out there?);
  - Tools & other useful community resources (including learning resources, publications);
  - Questions (community response & comment);
  - Glossary term submissions (community response & comment);
  - New initiatives happening around the world.

[<img alt="Watch Activity Illustration" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Watch_Activity.jpg" width="500" height="357">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Watch_Activity.jpg "Watch Activity Illustration")

### C. Committed Work 

In DCMI, committed work (i.e., work with an explicit agenda and more-or-less establish timeline, and more-or-less specific deliverables) are the function of task groups. Thus, when a metadata interest strand emerges in DCMI that frames some strategic objective or set of deliverables, a task group is formed to be responsible for governing the activity leading to reaching those objectives or completing the deliverables. Task Groups **usually** exist as sub-group of one or more standing groups--e.g., a task group of the Architecture Forum and the DCMI-Registry Community. However, DCMI may create task groups at the initiative level.

1. Task Group Deliverables (Organized as Drupal 'Book _nodes?)_
  - 'Specifications'
  - Best practice documents
  - Documentation
  - Learning resources

[<img alt="Work Activity Illustration" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Work_Activity.jpg" width="500" height="342">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Work_Activity.jpg "Work Activity Illustration")

## Kinds of DCMI Groups 

Groups are perhaps the most complex resources in DCMI and at the same time the least successfully served. Currently, they represent:

- Domains of metadata interest and expertise (e.g., [[DC-Government](http://dublincore.org/groups/government/)], [[DC-Education](http://dublincore.org/groups/education/)]; [[DC-Libraries](http://dublincore.org/groups/libraries/)]);
- Administrative bodies--e.g., DCMI's advisory and administrative groups; and 
- Functional areas and interests that cut across the entire metadata ecology (e.g., [[DC-Tools](http://dublincore.org/groups/tools/)] and [[DC-Registries](http://dublincore.org/groups/registry/)]). 

Frequently, groups are recursive in nature in that they can contain subgroups (e.g., "communities" that have "task groups") that need their own suite of all, or some subset, of the same functions as their parent). Since groups as a class can have sub-groups, the result can be a kind of Russian doll structure (of limited depth):

[<img alt="Russian Dolls image" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Russian_Dolls.jpg" width="250" height="161">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/Russian_Dolls.jpg "Russian Dolls image")

You'll see the term "bubble-up" here on the wiki. It means that the content "bubbles up" to parent levels. For example, a calendared event in a task group might bubble up to the calendar of its parent group; and, a community (group) announcement might bubble up to announcements at the top-level of DCMI.

## DCMI "Work Themes" 

At any given time, DCMI has a set of "work themes" that give focus to the Initiative as a whole. These themes address broad issues in metadata that cut across the more siloed interests of domain-specific subgroups within the Initiative. These DCMI-supported work themes receive targeted attention and commitment of resources from DCMI as an organization; and, therefore, these themes help shape the public perception of what DCMI is "doing" at any given point in time. The work themes change as the metadata ecology evolves. Administratively, the themes are determined from time-to-time by the Oversight Committee in light of evolving circumstances and input from the DCMI community.

With the current document repository website, these work themes are totally invisible leading to a public perception of a lack of focus. ***One key goal*** of the new DCMI community forum website is to give these themes appropriate emphasis <u>up front</u> as key factors in defining <u>who DCMI is</u> and <u>what DCMI does</u>.

The current work themes are as follows:

***Platform-independent Application Profiles***

<dl><dd> The DCMI Abstract Model (DCAM), published as a DCMI Recommendation in 2007, provides an abstract syntax for packaging Semantic-Web-compatible data in validatable record formats. DCAM was designed to bridge the modern paradigm of the unbounded Linked Data graph and the more familiar paradigm of the validatable metadata record, locally managed and constrained using a myriad of software platforms and implementation technologies. For five years, DCAM has inspired a wide range of deployment experiences, and the core RDF standards themselves continue to be extended. The activity "platform-independent application profiles" is re-evaluating the need and requirements for a common language to express metadata design patterns, both as templates for Linked-Data-compatible data formats and as reference points for creating and consuming coherent metadata within communities of discourse and practice.
</dd></dl>


***Mapping Diverse Vocabularies***

<dl><dd> While DCMI Metadata Terms and other core vocabularies increase the coherence of metadata by providing shared reference points, the unavoidable proliferation of diverse but overlapping vocabularies threatens to create metadata silos. A key part of the solution is to create machine-readable mappings. The activity "mapping diverse vocabularies" aims at mapping DCMI metadata terms to related terms in other vocabularies. In the absence of well-established practices for publishing and maintaining such mappings, this activity aspires to establish a workflow and publication practices that can be adopted by other vocabulary maintainers. The starting point for this activity is a mapping to the terms defined by the Schema.org initiative.
</dd></dl>


***Sustainable Vocabularies***

<dl><dd> As a foundation for applications, the value of any given vocabulary depends on the perceived certainty that the vocabulary -- both its machine-readable schemas and human-readable specification documents -- will remain reliably accessible over time and that its URIs will not be sold, re-purposed, or simply forgotten. In order to raise awareness of this issue, DCMI has formulated an agreement with the FOAF Project, which is owned by individuals, with contingency plans for transferring maintenance control in the short or long term should exigent circumstances require. This activity examines the issues around vocabulary sustainability and governance with the goal of formulating best practices and, ultimately, of ensuring that our vocabularies will be preserved by society's long-term memory institutions.
</dd></dl>

## DCMI as 'Social Enterprise' 

The major objective of the community forum website is to support both: (1) the DCMI community and its recognized groups in their ongoing work and interactions; and (2) the public seeking information about DCMI, its specifications and other resources. In keeping community interactions targeted, the community forum shares many characteristics of the social enterprise as opposed to a social network. For example, DCMI groups (communities, task groups, committees, boards) all have "leads" variously called "chairs", "moderators", "editors" etc. It is the function of these leads to shepherd/manage the groups, to lead conversations when they go stray and, when appropriate, push the group toward deliverables. In a Drupal context, these leads frame conversations, publish through blogs etc. As a result, the DCMI community forum is more like the [Symantec Community Connect](http://www.symantec.com/connect/) than Facebook.

## Website Theme (Look and Feel) 

Absolutely nothing regarding look and feel should be taken from the current document repository website except (perhaps) the square sunburst logo:

[<img alt="DCMI square logo" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/DCMI_logo_cropped.jpg" width="75" height="74">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/DCMI_logo_cropped.jpg "DCMI square logo")

Note that the shift from the DCMI website as document repository to community forum suggests:

[<img alt="DCMI Community Forum logo" src="/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/DCCF_logo.gif" width="605" height="67">](/archive/mediawiki_wiki/images/DCCF_logo.gif "DCMI Community Forum logo")

Suggestive terms:

- Lighten up!
- More focused
- More "air"
- Less text-intensive

## Drupal Commerce / Recurly 

Until now, DCMI has had a very limited membership program with: (1) a small set of institutional members; and (2) membership transactions managed by invoicing and bank transfers of annual membership fees. We are currently in the final stages of balloting major changes to the DCMI Bylaws to enable [a broader array of membership categories](/index.php?title=Memberships&action=edit&redlink=1 "Memberships (page does not exist)") including a Supporting Member category for individuals. Since the Supporting Member category will involve annual membership dues and ongoing renewal transactions, our current process with a handful of institutional members will not work. We will instead be relying on a Drupal module to handle the individual membership processes automatically. Ideally, this module will support:

- User joining and online payment of membership fees as part of the Drupal authenticated users processes;
- User access through their Drupal account to their membership information including cancellation of upcoming automatic renewals;
- Designation of "premium content" for early access by Supporting Members in good standing.

The only Drupal module we have seen that is tailored to these requirements is [Money$cripts](http://www.moneyscripts.net/). We are not familiar with [Drupal Commerce](http://www.drupalcommerce.org/) and look forward to seeing whether it will meet our needs.
