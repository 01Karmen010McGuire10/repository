### Workshop Preparation (before February 2012) 

- [Inventory of Learning Objectives](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Inventory)
  - Topics and skills related to Linked Data, the learning of which would be supported by the tool platform proposed in a deliverable of the Learning Linked Data Project.

- [Prerequisites for learning Linked Data](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Prerequisites)
  - Prerequisites for the study of the topics and skills listed in the Inventory of Learning Objectives.

- [Task Objectives](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Tasks) for Linked Data learners
  - Practical tasks enabled by learning things listed in the Inventory of Learning Objectives.

- [Personas](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Personas): Types of LD Learning Platform users
  - Types of audience to whom different topics and skills listed in the Inventory of Learning Objectives may be relevant.

- [Tools](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Tools) potentially usable in the LD Learning Platform
  - Existing tools usable in support of learning objectives.

- [Brainstorming](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data/Brainstorming) page for capturing ideas (most of which are moved to the pages above)

### Background on the project (as proposed in 2011) 

- [File:IMLSPlanningGrantNarrative.pdf](/mediawiki_wiki/files/IMLSPlanningGrantNarrative.pdf) of the IMLS grant
- 2011-09-27. [Project announcement](http://www.imls.gov/news/national_leadership_grant_announcement.aspx#WA)
- Grant Category: Planning Grants, Award Amount: $49,623; Matching Amount: $21,568 
- Contact: Dr Mike Crandall 206-897-1798
- Description: The University of Washington, Kent State University, University of North Carolina, JES & Company, and Talis Inc., will plan for the development of an integrated online learning platform to teach library and museum staff the principles and process of creating metadata for the modern Web environment, with particular focus on designing for an Open Linked Data environment. Metadata is used to describe information, and Open Linked Data is quickly growing as a way to publish data on the Web and facilitate the integration of information across diverse sources. The project partners will convene a workshop of educators and technology experts to assess requirements for a software platform in support of teaching the design of metadata for the modern Web environment. The planning project will provide a set of requirements for a technical (software) platform, based on an analysis of teaching needs and an inventory of existing and emerging open-source tools available for integration into such a platform.
- Note: Talis Inc is now "3 Round Stones, Inc"
- [Proposal narrative](/mediawiki_wiki/files/IMLSPlanningGrantNarrative.pdf)
- Excerpt from the proposal:
<pre>"This one-year planning project will focus on preparing, holding, and
following up on a workshop that will bring together software and technology
experts with teachers and trainers for the purpose of identifying the needs
and requirements of an open-source technology platform usable in classroom
or seminar settings ? online or face-to-face ? to teach students the
fundamentals of metadata design using Languages of Description. Definition
of critical components of this platform will be driven by requirements
deriving from an analysis of essential knowledge and methods students will
need to master in order to interpret Linked Data and create effective
applications

The intended results of this IMLS planning grant will therefore be:

1. a set of requirements for a technical (software) platform, based on an
   analysis of teaching needs in the area of metadata design using Languages
   of Description;
2. an inventory of existing and emerging open-source tools available for
   integration into such a platform;
3. an assessment of software development effort required to integrate the
   components, perhaps using a plug-in architecture with an ?orchestrator?
   function for scripting typical workflows; and
4. the specification of documentation that will be needed to make the
   package usable by its intended audience."
</pre>
### Project phases 
<dl>
<dt>Phase 1 (October 2011 through January 2012)
</dt>
<dd>Discussion on this mailing list to develop a curriculum outline for learning linked data, a tentative set of requirements for a learning platform for that curriculum, and a preliminary list of open source tools we might use for the platform as a starting point.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Phase 2 (February 2012)
</dt>
<dd>At the workshop itself, the participants will work through the initial requirements, identifying gaps, fleshing out details, and concluding with a set of recommendations for a fully realized framework. We will identify people who should be invited to review the draft framework.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Phase 3 (March 2012 through June 2012)
</dt>
<dd>The draft framework will be published on the University of Washington website for comment and discussion.
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Phase 4 (July 2012 through September 2012)
</dt>
<dd>The results of the discussion and workshop will be consolidated into a final report.
</dd>
