## DCMI Conference System 

DCMI has adopted the Open Conference System as software for managing web publishing, call for papers, and registration related to conferences and meetings it hosts. An effort to develop a documentation model for OCS instructional materials has resulted in preparation of a proposed documentation template and a background/literature review document justifying elements within that template (as well as elements purposely excluded). Both are linked and described below to facilitate stakeholder review and comment.

- [Proposed Template for Online Documentation](http://www.preciserecall.com/lis/files/ocs/): The template lays out elements to be included in any instructional document for an OCS procedure, with numbered notes citing justification from literature in instruction design for system documentation. (Those sources are discussed more fully in the literature review document linked below.) The template includes a timeline at the top summarizing the phases of OCS activity associated with a single event. Drop-down menus list tasks to be completed for each phase, and complete OCS documentation would include (at least) one procedure document for each task. Tasks are color-coded by user role, in recognition that multiple people would collaborate in managing an OCS event instance and to help those individuals identify tasks within their role's scope.
- Documentation Model for DCMI - [Word 44KB](http://www.preciserecall.com/lis/files/ocs/docModelForDCMI.docx), [PDF 160KB](http://www.preciserecall.com/lis/files/ocs/docModelForDCMI.pdf): This document reviews literature relevant to instruction design for system documentation and derives a model for application to instructional resources for the Open Conference System as an exemplar for DCMI systems overall.
- [Notes on OCS Documentation](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Conference_System/OCS_Documentation.md): This page lists sources consulted and related materials used in preparing the Documentation Model document.
