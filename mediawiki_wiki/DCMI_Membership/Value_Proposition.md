Why is it important to be a member? What are the rewards? What products and services are desired by our market that we are able to deliver to the membership? Providing value involves both understanding the need for content, community, savings, etc. and also your knowledge and ability to deliver what is needed.

## Models of Other Membership Organizations 

GREYNET is a good example of a typical membership organization model, with several membership levels tied to product and services offerings.

There are three membership levels – Associate (€2,000), Institutional (€1,000) and Individual (€295).

Information products and services include – printed journal, printed conference proceedings, printed newsletter, website, moderated listserv and membership directory.

Benefits include – representation on committees, guaranteed authorship/speaking slots, ads in publications, logo placement on website, inserts in conference materials, free or reduced conference registrations, invitations to awards dinner, free subscription to publications, enrollment in listservs, free document delivery from archive, directory listing.
