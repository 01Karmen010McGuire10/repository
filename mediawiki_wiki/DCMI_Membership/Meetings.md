## Minutes 

Distilled minutes from January 3, 2012 meeting of DCMI Membership Task Group.

### Brainstorming 

- At the moment the different types of sponsorship and membership are perhaps not as clear as they might be.
- Consider personal vs. organizational membership
- How do other organizations get funding (need to pull out old exploration of membership models (2001?)
- Questionnaire (multi-lingual) to get input on what kinds of membership might be attractive
- The value proposition is very important and currently the benefits are not clear or perhaps strong enough; Need to define benefits clearly for different types of audience, and think about different revenue streams (fees/pubs/events) as part of mix
- The exact role of DCMI is not as clear as it could be, for example what is DCMI’s role with respect linked data&nbsp;? there are many other initiatives in this area so we need to be able to be clear about this.
- Potential for teaching as revenue source, or teaching platform from IMLS grant
- Think about member categories other than region (linguistic, interest area?)
- Need to be careful to protect rights of existing members, but also pay attention to responsibilities
- Everything is on the table and we should not be limited in the sorts of futures there might be for DCMI and its sustainability

### Actions

1. Value proposition—matrix of benefits and costs, by audience. Joseph Busch lead, Ana and Paul will help
2. Membership structures—what models are there to follow? Paul will lead, Stuart will help
3. Current member value—what do members currently get out of relationship, what would they like? Rachel will lead, engage Finnish library in this.

Post drafts to wiki for comment and we will build on this in next meeting. Desired outcome: three statements of

1. benefits/costs by audience,
2. potential membership models for different audiences and
3. current state of value for existing members with assets and lacks identified
