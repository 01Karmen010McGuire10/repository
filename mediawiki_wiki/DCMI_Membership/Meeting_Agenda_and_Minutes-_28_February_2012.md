## Minutes 

### Meeting Recordings

Call recordings from first (3 January, 2012) and second (28 February, 2012) meetings available here (you will need your Advisory Board username and password to access):

- 3 January: [http://dublincore.org/advisoryboard/membershipTG/Membership\_call-2012-01-03.mov](http://dublincore.org/advisoryboard/membershipTG/Membership_call-2012-01-03.mov) (70.6MB)
- 28 February: [http://dublincore.org/advisoryboard/membershipTG/Membership\_call-2012-02-28.mov](http://dublincore.org/advisoryboard/membershipTG/Membership_call-2012-02-28.mov) (29.3MB)

### Work Item 1- Potential Value

[Work Item 1: Potential Value Proposition](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Membership/Value_Proposition "DCMI Membership/Value Proposition"): The group working on this item has distilled a list of products and services offered by DCMI to consider in thinking about present and future value. In addition, a number of organizational membership structures were analyzed for costs, membership categories, products and services, and benefits.

The organizations differ a great deal, with IDF standing out because no individual memberships are offered. Their business model clearly relates received benefits to level of contribution. AIS, on the other hand, is more focused on professionals as individuals, and mixes both institutional and individual memberships and benefits.

What DCMI can learn from this is that deciding what the organization wants to be should define the membership categories. Different services and benefits for different membership categories should be possible to define. To date, the narrow focus of DCMI on countries and organizations within countries, particularly on not-very-well funded entities such as libraries/archives/museums, has created a narrow band of membership options.

The takeaway from this discussion was that the DCMI audience(s) need to be defined, and services and benefits clearly described that will meet the needs of each of these audiences.

### Work Item 2: Current Member value proposition

[Work Item 2: Current Member Value Proposition](/index.php?title=DCMI_Membership/Member_Value_Proposition&action=edit&redlink=1 "DCMI Membership/Member Value Proposition (page does not exist)"): Due to Rachel’s work schedule, there has not been much activity in this area. However, the current membership benefits are clearly stated in the [Member Commitment and Benefits document](http://wiki.dublincore.org/images/8/87/Member_Commitment_and_Benefits.pdf). Stuart posted a bit of structure on the wiki page for this activity but still needs to be fleshed out further. Need to get a better perception of what current members see as the benefits for their organizations, beyond what is in the existing document.

One clear benefit that is called out for current members in the document is having a seat at the table. Paul pointed out, however, that the current description is diluted by calling out two places of membership, the Oversight Committee and the Advisory Board. Focusing just on the Oversight Committee membership would make the value proposition cleaner.

Currently, there seems to be a disconnect between the services and activities of DCMI and the membership structure; looking at this more closely may help provide ideas for moving forward. Raju, speaking as the lone member on the call, noted that one benefit for his organization is the visibility into where DCMI is headed and what directions the Advisory Board is taking, since Dublin Core was adopted as a national standard for Singapore. He noted that at present, the distance between linked data and current practice is a problem, and the emphasis in DCMI on linked data is actually a disadvantage for the Singapore National Library rather than an advantage, since it is moving away from their actual use of DCMI products.

### Work Item 3- Membership Structure

[Work Item 3: Membership Structures](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Membership/Membership_Structure "DCMI Membership/Membership Structure"): Stuart noted that this overlapped somewhat with the first task, but the work item page has the current breakdown, as well as examples of other organizations’ structure and a brief analysis of options available. Paul suggested that it might be worth getting feedback from other organizations on what had worked well for them in their approach. This also raises the question of whether the current member structure is viable long term. We will need to look at this in terms of modifications to the structure.

Investigation of options besides an independent entity may be needed. DCMI was a project of OCLC for many years—are there other partnerships that might be beneficial for the organization moving forward? One example is the IA Institute/ASIST relationship where infrastructure for meetings and communication is provided by ASIST while IA Institute maintains its separate identity.

### Discussion

In response to a question of whether it is more important to stick to timeline or follow the new pathways that have emerged from our investigations, Stuart noted that the overall purpose of this investigation is to move DCMI toward a sustainable model for the future. He would like to take the time to do that well as long as the committee members are agreeable. The consensus was that this is in fact what we should be doing, so agreement on expanding the scope to include additional work items was reached.

Paul noted that there was an area that could potentially add value to the discussion, an exploration of use cases related to DCMI products and services to establish clear linkages between audiences and the benefits DCMI can provide them. This will put the focus on demand rather than perceived value. Use cases should be developed for institutions as well as individuals, given the models that have been investigated to date.

### Next Meetings

From the Doodle polls and members on the call, the following dates were established for our next meetings (at the same times as our last two meetings):

- Tuesday, April 3
- Thursday, May 17

### Action Items and New Activities

Based on the results of the current investigation and our discussion, we determined that there are four new areas that need to be explored. Members volunteered to take on this work as a lead-in to our next call on April

- [Work Item 4: Investigate audiences for DCMI services and products](/index.php?title=DCMI_Membership/Audiences&action=edit&redlink=1 "DCMI Membership/Audiences (page does not exist)") (Ana & Joseph in consultation with Raju, Rachel, Dixon as current members)
- [Work Item 5: Investigate what works for other organizations—lessons learned](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Membership/Lessons_Learned "DCMI Membership/Lessons Learned") (Paul, Stuart)
- [Work Item 6: Investigate partnership options as an alternative to an independent DCMI](/index.php?title=DCMI_Membership/Partnerships&action=edit&redlink=1 "DCMI Membership/Partnerships (page does not exist)") (Stuart)
- [Work Item 7: Develop use cases for services and products](/index.php?title=DCMI_Membership/Use_Cases&action=edit&redlink=1 "DCMI Membership/Use Cases (page does not exist)") (Paul to provide example, others will contribute based on that)

More work needs to be done on the [Current Member Value](/index.php?title=DCMI_Membership/Member_Value_Proposition&action=edit&redlink=1 "DCMI Membership/Member Value Proposition (page does not exist)") work item already established. Rachel will hopefully be able to engage another member in exploring this area before our next call.
