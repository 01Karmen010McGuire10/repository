## Current DCMI Membership Structure 

### Category: Member 

1. Criteria and Rights: The Member category of DCMI membership is the only category required by Singapore law and the [DCMI Articles of Association](/images/9/9b/Articles_of_Association_2008.pdf "Articles of Association 2008.pdf"). By statute, the _Member_ category is the set of legal voting entities of DCMI. Individual _Member_ representatives are members of the Oversight Committee through DCMI by-laws; and, by default, _Member_ representatives are members of the Advisory Board.
2. Relevant Provisions of the [DCMI Articles of Association](/images/9/9b/Articles_of_Association_2008.pdf "Articles of Association 2008.pdf"): 
  - (¶ 5) The number of _Members_ which DCMI proposes to be registered is unlimited.
  - (¶ 7(a)) No organizations or associations (“institutions”) shall be admitted as a _Member_ of DCMI unless first approved by the Board and the Board shall have full discretion as to the admission of any institutions to Membership of DCMI, save that such discretion shall always be objectively exercised
  - (¶ 8(a)) _Member_ needs to be an incorporated public entity, a not-for-profit organization, a governmental agency, or a supra-governmental agency.
  - (¶ 8(b)) _Member_ may represent a consortium or group of organizations or agencies.
  - (¶ 8(c)) _Member_ has exclusive coverage within the _Locale of Influence_ agreed to by the _Member_ and DCMI. DCMI will manage relationships with multinational corporations and supranational agencies unless other arrangements are agreed in writing between DCMI and _Member_.
  - (¶ 8(d)) _Members_ may adopt business models that include individual or institutional memberships or other types of funding through grants, contributions, or institutional sponsorship. The main focus of _Members_ is the development of a constituency of local organizations within their _Locale of Influence_.
  - (¶ 12) DCMI appoints a _Member_ as the exclusive representative and collaborator in the formal support of DCMI’s Membership Program within the Locale of Influence.
  - (¶ 16(a)) The Board shall have the absolute discretion to remove any _Member_ of the DCMI who in the reasonable opinion of the Board is guilty of conduct derogatory to the dignity or injurious to the reputation or interest of DCMI or is in the reasonable opinion of the Board deemed unsuitable or undesirable to continue to be a _Member_ of DCMI.
3. Relevant Definitions:
  - ***Member:*** The members of DCMI for the time being and from time to time as defined by these Articles.
  - ***Locale of Influence:*** The region or political boundary in which a _Member_ is chartered. Typically this will be defined by national boundaries; however organizations from more than one country may find it expedient to create a _Member_ that spans national boundaries but is unified by common language, culture or other interest.

### Category: Partner 

The _Partner_ category is not part of legal structure of DCMI. _Partner_ rights are determined by partnership agreement and [published schedule](http://dublincore.org/about/partnership/index.shtml%7Ccurrent). Fee structure is determined and periodically reviewed by Oversight Committee at the recommendation of the Board. Appointment at discretion of the Board. Please note that the _Partner_ program has not been particularly successful (one likely reason: ROI even more murky than with the _Member_ program).

### Analysis 

Since the _Member_ category of DCMI membership is the only category mandated by statute and defined in the [DCMI Articles of Association](/images/9/9b/Articles_of_Association_2008.pdf "Articles of Association 2008.pdf"), DCMI is at liberty to:

1. Create any new categories it deems useful;
2. Modify the existing _Partner_ program; and
3. Change fee structures as required from time to time by the Articles with consideration given to better aligning fees to both intangible and tangible ROI and other economic circumstances.

If the goal turns out to be the modification of the DCMI governance structure stemming from the membership programs, then modifications to the Articles will be necessary (but doable). Possible Article modifications might include:

1. Extending _Member_ status to include "domain influence" as well as the current "locale influence" with the goal of diversifying and increasing the size of the _Member_ category (obviously with a suitable definition of "domain influence" that provides for future developments); and
2. Instituting an _Individual Membership_ program possibly with "premium" access to defined sets of resources (etc.) and with possible representation at the _Member_ (governance) level based on some formula.

### International DOI Foundation 

[http://www.doi.org/membership/brochure.html](http://www.doi.org/membership/brochure.html)

#### Legal Form 

The IDF is a registered not-for-profit foundation, with a legal charter and formally declared bye-laws. It was founded in 1998.

#### Governance 

The IDF is governed by members, through an elected board, with all board seats being for a three year period.

#### Membership Categories 

There are three membership categories:

- General Members (Open to all organisations with a general interest and who want to support the development and use of the DOI system
- Charter Members (For organisations with a direct interest in publishing or producing intellectual property - this is decided by the board)
- Registration Agencies (Organisations which allocate DOIs to registrants to use - this is a formal role with additional formal agreements)
- Affiliate Members

General and charter members have identical rights and benefits.

The current list of members (with an indication of current board-membership) in each category can be seen here: [http://www.doi.org/idf-member-list.html](http://www.doi.org/idf-member-list.html)

While IDF is itself a not-for-profit organisation, the members are a mixture of commercial and not-for-profit organisations.

#### Fee Structure 

Fees are paid by all members on an annual basis. Amounts vary between membership categories, including a token fee for affiliation membership. Fees may also be adjusted according to need for-not-for-profit organisations at the discretion of the board.

##### Membership Fees 

Fees are given here at the bottom of this page: [http://www.doi.org/membership/brochure.html](http://www.doi.org/membership/brochure.html)

However, I think this may be somewhat out of date. I can ask for more up-to-date information on this.

#### Other Revenue Streams 

None of significance

#### Mission 

"The DOI® System represents a significant step forward in the exchange of information in electronic form. Please join us in developing and shaping the infrastructure for electronic publishing and information dissemination, and ensuring the effective respect of copyright."
