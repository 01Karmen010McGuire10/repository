- [Web Protege](http://protegewiki.stanford.edu/wiki/WebProtege), used in [Marcia's IMLS Project](http://www.imls.gov/news/national_leadership_grant_announcement.aspx#OH)
- [RDFLib](http://rdflib.net), a Python library for working with RDF, of which Ed is an owner

- Marcia: design an interactive decision making tool to guide people in [choosing a metadata property](http://aims.fao.org/lode/bd/rights), perhaps on the model of NPR's flowchart for [choosing a science fiction book](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/flowchart-for-navigating-nprs-top-100-sff-books/).

- Marcia: NSDL [Science Literacy Maps [http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/](http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/)]. NSDL Science Literacy Maps are a tool for teachers and students to find resources that relate to specific science and math concepts. The maps illustrate connections between concepts as well as how concepts build upon one another across grade levels. Clicking on a concept within the maps will show NSDL resources relevant to the concept, as well as information about related AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks and National Science Education Standards.
  - Stuart: The AAAS strandmaps were (still are?) hand-crafted graph mappings subsequently hard-wired into NSDL infrastructure. The ASN's extension of the strandmap concept (learning planes) is technically enabled through its mapping tool where RDF graphs of such mappings as strand maps can be generated by anyone with domain knowledge but with no conception of, or desire to know about, angle brackets.
- Craig: For a hands-on-lab
  - Domain modeling tools, perhaps RDF-independent?
  - Access to a pool of existing vocabularies
  - Tools for creating new vocabularies, properties, and classes
  - An environment for publishing new vocabularies (e.g., the ability to mind your own URIs)
  - Tools for composing application profiles from existing vocabularies
  - Tools for creating concrete implementations/records
  - Tools to ingest into a database/store -- perhaps legacy (e.g., RDB) and triple
  - An environment for query/retrieval
  - Ample examples and best practices

- Craig: Tools should have a lower barrier of entry. More technical students can always dig deeper.
- KarenW: Examples using FOAF profiles might be a good place to start, as the vocabulary is simple and might be fairly easy for a general audience to engage with. I was recently looking around at the FOAF project site ( [http://www.foaf-project.org/](http://www.foaf-project.org/)) and found FOAF-a-Matic ( [http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic](http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic)), which lets you build a FOAF profile for yourself with a web form. So that's a possible way to get learners to be engaged with creating linked data themselves pretty quickly.
- Diane: The [Open Metadata Registry sandbox](http://sandbox.metadataregistry.org/) allows users to experiment with building element sets and vocabularies in a form-based environment. Several iSchool faculty members have reported that they've found it useful for students, and there have been a number of users trying it out for real projects over the years.

<dd>A more extensive list with comparison tables that indicate additional technical details 9e.g. supported databases, query languages). Most importantly, this site includes information on the number of developers working on the toolkit, the number of downloads (if known) and whether there is an active mailing list. This information gives an idea of the size of the project and whether it has an active user community for support and sharing.

<dd>The W3C's Semantic Web wiki provides information on about 275 tools divided into about two dozen categories (e.g. "RDF generator," "SPARQL endpoints," "Validator"). Because it is a wiki you can easily see the history of the entries and therefore get a quick idea of the "freshness" of the information.

<dd>Mike Bergman has compiled a list of about one thousand tools in a small number of categories. The list is searchable by category or keyword in the name or description. This is a handy list if you are looking for a tool in a particular programming language, because you can filter retrievals by language. Be sure to check the web pages of the tool to get an idea of its level of use and community support.

Date: Wed, 20 Feb 2013 14:31:55 -0500 From: Ethan Gruber Subject: Fuseki and other SPARQL servers

Hi all,

I have been playing around with Fuseki ( [http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving\_data/index.html](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/index.html)) for a few months to get my feet wet with accessing and querying RDF. I quite like it. I find it well documented and easy to set up. We will soon deploy a SPARQL server in a production environment, and I would like to know if others on the list have experience with Fuseki in production, or have other recommendations. Mulgara is off the table as it inexplicably conflicts with other apps installed in Tomcat.

Thanks, Ethan

Hi Ethan!

We've been using Jena/Fuseki in papyri.info for about a year now, iirc. We started with Mulgara, but switched. It's running in its own Jetty container in our system, but I've had no performance issues with it whatever.

Best, Hugh

Hi Hugh,

I have investigated the possibility of deploying Fuseki as a war in Tomcat ( [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-201](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-201)) because I wasn't sure how the default Jetty container would respond in production, but since you aren't having any problems with that deployment, I may go ahead and do that.

Jetty's performance characteristics are really very good. I'd have no hesitation in using it.

Fuseki/Jetty will have no problems scaling, it's what the Talis Platform used for large datasets. I also ran a large dataset for quite a while with it.

Which backend are you using? TDB? SDB?

TDB as per the startup instruction: "fuseki-server --loc=DB /DatasetPathName"

I've been using Fuseki for a while myself and have been using it in production. It can be a bit tricky to configure when you want to connect to a jena SDB but it, along with a small jar file from one of the jena developers that manages the SDB database connection, it works pretty well.

If you want to have more fun with Fuseki, check out the linked data API implementations called Elda (a java impl) or Puelia (PHP) and connect it to your Fuseki endpoint.

If forgot about that. That issue was created quite awhile ago and I hadn't check on it in a long time. I've found that Jetty has worked fine in our production environment so far. As I wrote earlier, I have it connecting to a jena SDB that is used for a semantic web application (VIVO) that was developed here. Although we have the semantic web application running on a different server than the SDB database I found the performance was fairly significantly improved by having the Fuseki server running on the same machine as the SDB.

I'll add that the LARQ plugin for Fuseki (which adds Lucene indexes) is pretty awesome, as well.

-Ross.
