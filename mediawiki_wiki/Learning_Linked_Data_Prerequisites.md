## Prerequisites for Learning Linked Data 

### Beginning 

- Understanding of basic natural-language grammar (e.g., nouns, verbs, sentence structure)
- Familiarity with personal computers [kc: need to define "familiarity." Also, need to decide at what level some \*nix skills are needed, because those are essential for most of the tools. I'll add that to advanced, but it may be needed earlier.]
- Basics of information organization (e.g., metadata, classification) [kc: there will be many people in the library environment who never learned basics of information organization. They learned librarianship _as it is practiced_ but not much background. We need to decide if we will cover that data or exclude those folks.] [dih: If we are talking 'prerequisite' certainly we could provide some useful readings? Svenonius comes to mind, but there might be lighter fare.][Diane: Yes to lighter fare. I haven't found a simple intro to metadata yet, but have a lot of bits and pieces of it in my JAL column [http://kcoyle.net/jal.html](http://kcoyle.net/jal.html) and various talks. I'm working this into the training that I will be doing later this year.]
- Web basics (e.g., browsers and URLs)
- Diagramming/modeling basics (e.g., boxes and arrows)

### Intermediate 

- Familiarity with Web technologies and software (e.g., HTTP, URL, URI)
- Basic knowledge of XML (e.g., documents, elements, attributes, namespaces)
- Basic familiarity with data models and modeling (e.g., ER, XML Schema)
- Exposure to query languages (e.g., SQL or XPath)
- Familiarity with vocabularies, authority control, and standards bodies such as W3C

### Advanced 

- Intermediate-level skill in computer programming
- Basic \*nix skills; command line
- Ability to install programs on variety of platforms
- Familiarity with more advanced modeling techniques (e.g., UML/OO)
- Familiarity with different data models (e.g., relational, hierarchical, graph)
- Familiarity with sets and graphs and why they're important for the web
- Familiarity with formal semantics

### Discussion 

- Diane: The prerequisites are an area where an understanding of audiences needs to be added. Most of the beginning/intermediate/advanced categories don't apply to all the folks we're hoping to reach.
