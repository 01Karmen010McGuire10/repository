Specific issues which the Committee is charged to address:

- The Directorate will prepare, and the Committee will review the DCMI Annual Budget and Revenue Plan. The Committee may make recommendations to the Directorate and/or the Governing Board as part of the annual budget approval process
- The Directorate will make periodic financial reports to the Committee so that the Committee will have a clear and current picture of DCMI's financial health
- Approval authority for the DCMI Annual Budget and Revenue Plan shall rest with the Governing Board

**Special budget items:**

- Minor unbudgeted items (i.e. not budgeted in the approved annual budget and less than $5,000 USD) may be considered and approved by the Committee if adequate uncommitted funds are on hand and do not require approval by the full Governing Board.
- Major unbudgeted (i.e. not budgeted in the approved annual budget and exceeding $5,000 USD) expenditures or requests for special funding will be vetted by Committee, and the Committee will provide a disposition to the Governing Board based on its review of each request. 
- Approval authority for special expenditures ultimately shall rest with the Governing Board.

**DCMI events and workshops:**

- If an event's budget is less than $10,000 USD, the budget and fee-scale may be reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee
- If an event's budget is greater than $10,000 USD , the budget and fee-scale shall be vetted by the Committee and referred to the Governing Board for disposition. (Exception: the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications and DCMI Annual Meeting)

**International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications:**

- Preliminary approval authority for the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications Budget and Revenue Plan shall rest with the Executive Committee, and the Executive Committee shall be empowered to direct and approve negotiations by the Directorate on behalf of DCMI for matters related to the event. 
- The Membership & Finance Committee will be provided the opportunity to review and provide feedback on the financials (including expected revenue, expenditures, fee-scales, grants, and sponsorships) for the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications. When the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications Budget and Revenue Plan have been finalized, the Committee shall review, recommend a disposition, and refer to the Governing Board for final action.
- Final approval authority for the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications Budget and Revenue Plan shall rest with the Governing Board.

**DCMI Annual Meeting:**

- Preliminary approval authority for the DCMI Annual Meeting arrangements shall rest with the Executive Committee, and the Executive Committee shall be empowered to direct and approve negotiations by the Directorate on behalf of DCMI for matters related to the event. 
- The Membership & Finance Committee will be provided the opportunity to review and provide feedback on the financials (including expected expenditures, and -- if applicable -- revenue) for the DCMI Annual Meeting. When the DCMI Annual Meeting Budget has been finalized, the Committee shall review, recommend a disposition, and refer to the Governing Board for final action.
- Final approval authority for the DCMI Annual Meeting shall rest with the Governing Board.

<dl><dd> Note: If desired the DCMI Annual Meeting Budget and the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications Budget and Revenue Plan may be consolidated into a single document and the two events treated as a whole for the purposes of review and approval.
