# Wednesday, June 11, 2014 Meeting 

## Agenda 

1. Confirm Paul Walk as nominee for new Independent Board Member
2. Confirm Joe Tennis as nominee for new Chair-Elect
3. Next steps
4. Old Business

## Meeting Summary 

Present: Mike Crandall, Stuart Sutton, Dickson Lukose, Joseph Tennis Unable to join because of technical difficulties: Ulla Ikaheimo, Eric Childress

1. **Paul Walk:** Paul has agreed to stand for nomination as a new Independent Member of the Governing Board. He is unfortunately unable to take on the role of Chair-Elect, but will bring great strengths to this role from his past work in the UK, and his current position with EDINA. The committee agreed to support his nomination and Mike will move forward with this to the full board for approval and vote.
2. **Chair-Elect:** Joseph Tennis has agreed to stand for nomination as Chair-Elect for next year, so we have a current board member willing to take on this role, which resolves the issue of by-laws compliance. Joe will also bring excellent qualities to this leadership role, and his recent election as president of ISKO also provides a strong connection to another international metadata community.
3. **Next Steps:** Mike will forward the recommendations of the committee to the full Governing Board with a request for approval of nominations and a call for additional nominations for Chair-Elect, followed by a request for vote once the nominations have been approved. Once we have settled these matters, our next task will be to tackle bylaws revisions. Stuart has been working on a draft which we can start from. Our next meeting will be June 25(Finland: 5:00PM-6:00PM; Seattle: 7:00AM-8:00AM; Kuala Lumpur: 10:00PM-11:00PM)
4. **Old Business--Staggered terms for Independent Members:** A suggestion has been made that we institute staggered 3 year renewable terms for Independent Members, with the current members initiating the rotation. Shigeo will need to be re-nominated and approved this year if we follow the suggested rotations. We should discuss this with the GB as we move ahead with the voting for a new Independent Member.

## Actions

1. Mike will send the nominations for Independent Member (Paul Walk) and Chair-Elect (Joe Tennis) to the GB for approval and additional nominations.
2. Once approved, Mike will call for a GB vote on these roles.
