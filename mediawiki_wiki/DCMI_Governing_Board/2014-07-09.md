## Summary 

Present: Mike Crandall, Dickson Lukose, Judy Ng, Kyong-Eun Oh, Stuart Sutton, Joseph Tennis

Not Present: Eric Childress,Ulla Ikaheimo, Sam Oh, Shigeo Sugimoto

- **Nominations and Bylaws committee report**
  - **Elected officer and new board member:** Paul Walk has been elected as a new independent Governing Board member, and Joseph Tennis has been elected as Chair-Elect of the Governing Board. Both will take office in October at the Annual Meeting.
  - **Proposal for staggered terms for independent members:** To formalize the three year terms for Independent members, a proposal has been made to assign end dates to current members. Since a quorum was not present on the call, an email call for vote will be made to confirm these dates and the reappointment of Shigeo Sugimoto for another three year term. Additional discussion of Independent Members will be part of the Nominations and Bylaws work over the next few months, with a proposal for future actions in this area presented to the Board in October at the Annual Meeting. 

- **Membership and Finance committee report**
  - **Reduced individual membership fees:** The GB voted to reduce the individual member fees to $75, with student fees reduced to $35. These have taken effect July 1 in connection with Conference registration, and will be reflected on the DCMI website by the third week in July with the rebuild. 
  - **Changes to annual meeting fee structure:** Again, the GB voted in favor of changing the annual meeting registration fees to reflect the new Individual Member prices, with non-member registration including an automatic charge for Individual Membership added to the base registration fee. This is now in place on the conference registration site. 
  - **Proposal from Membership and Finance Committee to form a task force to review the Annual Conference/Meeting finances:** The task force will move ahead with its work over the coming months, and bring a final proposal back to the full board on completion of its work. Any modifications will likely take effect after the 2016 meeting in Europe, because of already existing commitments with the conference hosts for the next two years. 
  - **Delay of budget review, 6 month contracts approval:** Until future directions are solidified with current planning efforts, we are operating on the existing budget. Because the Directorate salaries have been on 6 month contracts pending fund availability, a renewal for Stuart and Tom was needed on July 1. Email approval by the GB will be requested to extend these contracts through December. Full budget review by the Membership and Finance committee will be undertaken in the next few months, with a new budget presented to the GB for approval in October. 
- **Updates on annual and regional meetings:** Planning for the meetings is going well. The Annual Meeting will be on Saturday, October 11. At the moment, a working lunch for the Governing Board is planned for 12-1:30 that day, with the Nominations and Bylaws Committee meeting from 1:30-2:30 and the Finance and Membership Committee meeting from 2:30-3:30. The formal meeting of the Governing Board will be from 5:30-6:30 that evening. Members may also be interested in attending the Advisory Board and Technical Board meetings along with committee meetings during the day. A full schedule can be found on the [conference website](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/annual14)<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>. Stuart has scheduled nine webinars through the coming year with ASIS&T, and will be working with the Advisory Board Education and Outreach Committee to develop programming for these. All Institutional and Regional members of the Governing Board have full access to these webinars if they want to use them for their organizations.
- **New business:** Stuart mentioned that an initiative to examine the future of DCMI Publications is being explored, and the AB committees will be investigating possible ways to more fully utilize the OJS system to publish best practices and other types of reports in the future.

## Action Items 

- **Vote on Independent Member Terms:** Mike will send out a request for vote on setting end dates for Independent Members, along with re-appointment of Shigeo Sugimoto for another three year term starting in October 2014.

- **Directorate Contract Renewal:** Mike will send out a request for vote on a six month renewal of the Directorate contracts, through December of 2014.
