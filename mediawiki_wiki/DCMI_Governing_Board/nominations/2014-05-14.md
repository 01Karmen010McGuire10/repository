# Wednesday, May 14, 2014 Meeting 

## Agenda 

1. Review schedule for chair-elect nomination
2. Decision on independent member nomination
3. Suggested candidates for independent member
4. Staggered terms for independent members
5. Next steps

## Meeting Summary 

Present: Mike Crandall, Stuart Sutton Regrets: Joseph Tennis Absent: Dickson Lukose, Ulla Ikaheimo

1. **Schedule for chair-elect nomination:** On schedule so far, though will need rapid responses from committee on today's discussion to move ahead in a timely manner. We need to keep to schedule to make the July 9 GB meeting for election of a chair-elect candidate.
  1. April 30: Mike will solicit nominations for a potential Independent Member from Governing Board members. **COMPLETE**
  2. by May 13: Deadline for submission of Independent Member nominations, to be discussed in our May 14 call. **COMPLETE**
  3. by May 27: N&B Committee will follow up with selected Independent Member candidate(s) to determine interest/availability and choose candidate(s) for presentation to the Governing Board for vote by June 4. 
  4. by June 10: N&B Committee will confirm vote by email on June 4. Selected Independent Member (if any) will be asked to confirm acceptance by June 10. 
  5. June 11: N&B Committee will prepare call for nominations for Chair-elect (including new Independent Member if one is chosen) in June 11 meeting, to be distributed to Governing Board immediately following the meeting.
  6. by June 23: Governing Board members will be asked to submit names for Chair-elect nominations (including new Independent Member in their considerations if one is chosen).
  7. June 24: N&B Committee will review nominations and decide on Chair-elect candidate(s). Candidate(s) bio(s) and N&B Committee recommendation (if any) will be distributed to Governing Board for review prior to July 9 Governing Board meeting.
  8. July 9: Chair-elect candidate will be elected (hopefully!!) by Governing Board in their meeting on this date immediately prior to the N&B Committee meeting (which you will all attend, as members of the Governing Board).
2. **Independent Member nomination:** All members of the Governing Board were in favor of moving ahead with the selection of a fourth Independent Member to fill the vacant slot under the current bylaws. Shigeo expressed an interest in adding someone from Europe if possible.
3. **Independent Member candidates:** A number of names have been put forth, we need to winnow this down by email since committee members were not present. Mike will follow up to the list with an action to respond to suggestions and come up with 2-3 names to approach for interest.
4. **Staggered terms for Independent Members:** A suggestion has been made that we institute staggered 3 year renewable terms for Independent Members, with the current members initiating the rotation. Shigeo will need to be re-nominated and approved this year if we follow the suggested rotations. We should discuss this with the GB as we move ahead with the voting for a new Independent Member.
5. **Next Steps:** see Actions below. Our next meeting will be May 28 (Finland: 5:00PM-6:00PM; Seattle: 7:00AM-8:00AM; Kuala Lumpur: 10:00PM-11:00PM), when we should be ready to present recommended candidates to the GB for email vote.

## Actions

1. Mike will send list of proposed Independent Member candidates to N&B Committee for discussion and choice of 2-3 to pursue.
2. All will review proposed candidates and send input to list by 5/17.
3. Mike will approach selected candidates to determine interest/availability (or if no one responds will choose best fit and pursue).
4. All will try to join May 28th meeting to confirm candidates and approve submission to GB for vote.
