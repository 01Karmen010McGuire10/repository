# Wednesday, April 30, 2014 Meeting 

## Agenda 

1. Review of Nominations and Bylaws Committee charter and scope: [/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI\_Governing\_Board/nominations](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Governing_Board/nominations)
2. Process/calendar for collecting nominations/voting for Chair-Elect of the Governing Board
3. Process for review/assist with other board/committee nominations and elections
4. Bylaws revision schedule: [http://dublincore.org/about/bylaws/index.shtml](http://dublincore.org/about/bylaws/index.shtml)
5. Future meeting schedule for Nominations and Bylaws Committee

## Meeting Summary 

Present: Mike Crandall, Dickson Lukose, Stuart Sutton, Joseph Tennis Regrets: Ulla Ikaheimo

1. **Committee Charter and Scope:** No comments on current draft in [handbook](/mediawiki_wiki/DCMI_Governing_Board/nominations)<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>. All encouraged to edit as thoughts occur so that we can flesh out missing sections.
2. **Nominations/elections process:** After some discussion, it was agreed that we would try to fill the remaining independent member position on the board before proceeding with a call for nominations. We also clarified that the nomination for chair-elect needs to come from the pool of board members (including a new independent member if one is chosen). The goal is to have a new chair-elect in time for the annual meeting this year, which puts us on a tight timeline. With the understanding that the process we use this year will be used as a template for a more formal version in next year’s nomination/election process (minus the independent member selection), we agreed on the following steps/schedule (built around a bi-weekly meeting schedule for the committee):
  1. April 30: Mike will solicit nominations for potential independent members from Governing Board members.
  2. by May 13: Deadline for submission of independent member nominations, to be discussed in our May 14 call. 
  3. by May 27: N&B Committee will follow up with selected independent member candidates to determine interest/availability and choose candidate(s) for presentation to the Governing Board for vote by June 4. 
  4. by June 10: Committee will confirm vote by email on June 4. Selected independent member will be asked to confirm acceptance by June 10. 
  5. June 11: N&B committee will prepare call for nominations for Chair-elect (including new independent member) in June 11 meeting, to be distributed to Governing Board immediately following the meeting.
  6. by June 23: Governing Board members will be asked to submit names for Chair-elect nominations (including new independent member in their considerations).
  7. June 24: N&B Committee will review nominations and decide on chair-elect candidate(s). Candidate(s) bio(s) and committee recommendation will be distributed to Governing Board for review prior to July 9 Governing Board meeting.
  8. July 9: Chair-elect candidate will be elected (hopefully!!) by Governing Board in their meeting on this date immediately following N&B meeting.
3. **Other board/committee nominations/elections:** We agreed that this coming year will be somewhat ad hoc, but we should be thinking about how this committee can begin to systematize the nomination/election process across the organization. At the very least, there should be an oversight process which includes calendaring of the nominations/elections process, development of guidelines for selection and confirmation of candidates, and documentation of processes. This should be on the agenda for each of the Board meetings in Austin.
4. **Bylaws revisions:** Stuart volunteered to do a draft revision of the bylaws as a working document for us. We will come back to this after July 9th when the nominations/election process is complete.
5. **Future committee meetings:** We agreed to hold bi-weekly meetings on this same day and time at least through July 9th. Schedule as follows:
<pre> *Finland: 5:00 PM-6:00 PM *May 14
    *Seattle: 7:00 AM-8:00 AM *May 28
    *Kuala Lumpur: 10:00 PM-11:00 PM *June 11
                                            *June 25
                                            *July 9
</pre>
## Actions

1. Mike will distribute request for Independent Board Member nominations to Governing Board April 30.
2. All will contribute nominees by May 13.
3. All will review timeline for nomination/election process in minutes and contribute corrections/additions before May 13.
