## Agenda 

1. Update on restructuring progress. Final Board/Committee structure, chair appointments, current information on wiki <sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>.
2. Governing Board subcommittee (Membership and Finance, Nominations and Bylaws) membership and next steps. Eric and I are suggesting that the each GB member be appointed to one committee for an annual, renewable term. See ACTION below.
3. Elections for next year- the Nominations and Bylaws Committee will need to develop and manage the process, but all should be thinking of who might be candidates for Chair-Elect and whether and how we want to fill the single remaining independent member position on the Board. The goal should be to complete these votes before the annual meeting so that the new officer (and new independent member if chosen) would be at the Annual GB meeting.
4. Updates on annual meeting, regional meetings, standards activities (Stuart Sutton)

BOARD MEMBER ACTION: <u>By April 5th</u> -- Please respond with your first and second choice of committees (committee information is available on the wiki at <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[2]</a></sup> and <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup>).

Email your preferences directly to me at mikecran@uw.edu. If we do not hear from you by April 5th, Eric and I will assign you to one of the committees.

## Summary 

Present: Eric Childress, Mike Crandall, Judy Ng, Sam Oh, Stuart Sutton, Joseph Tennis Regrets: Ulla Ikaheimo, Daniel Joudrey Not Present: Dickson Lukose, Shigeo Sugimoto

1. **Restructuring Update:** The only question/comment raised was about individual DCMI membership being required as a condition of membership on a Standing Committee. Current practice is not to require this, but it should be something that is discussed more fully as we move into a more member-driven organization. This is something that would be in the remit of the Finance and Membership Committee to move forward. 
2. **GB Committee Membership:** Those present concurred with the committee assignments proposed in the [spreadsheet](http://wiki.dublincore.org/images/3/30/GB_committees.pdf)<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup>. Eric and Mike will move ahead with scheduling working meetings for each committee shortly, and communicate directly with the committees through the new JISCMail listservs that Stuart is setting up.
3. **Elections:** Mike and Eric's terms will run through the Annual Meeting, but we need to plan now for nominating and electing a Chair-Elect for next year, which will provide us with a full complement of officers next year with Mike moving to the Past-Chair position. In the meantime, Mike will work with the Nominations and Bylaws Committee to draft a nomination/election process and get that back for review and approval of the Board. If you have suggestions for nominees for Chair-Elect, or would like to self-nominate, please let Mike know.
4. **Conference and ISO Updates:** Sam indicated that a regional meeting for the Asian iSchools is in planning stages for June, and wondered if this would be a good opportunity to host a regional DCMI meeting as well. Stuart recommended coordinating with the DCMI AsiaPAC group on this.

## Action Items 

- **Dates for Future Meetings:** Mike will set up dates for our quarterly meetings through the end of the year and get those out to the Board.

- **Setup Board Committee Meetings:** Mike and Eric will setup Committee meetings with the members of each committee.

- **Nominations for Chair-Elect:** All will send suggestions for Chair-Elect nominees to Mike, and Mike will lead development of process for nominations/elections with the Nominations and Bylaws Committee.

- **Asia Regional Meeting:** Sam and Stuart will coordinate on best way to move this idea forward.
