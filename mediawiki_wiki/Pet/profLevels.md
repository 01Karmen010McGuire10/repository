# **{ DRAFT }** Proficiency Levels Introduction 

Proficiency scales (vocabularies) are widely used as a means of recording the level of knowledge, skill or experience required by a typical worker or learner when executing a specific set of skills or tasks. A specific competency statement in the LD4PE competency index may have an array of knowledge and skills statements that express increasing complexity as learners develop that competency. Appropriate proficiency level(s) from this developing vocabulary may be assigned as an attribute of those individual statements of knowledge and skills.

The { DRAFT } proficiency scale set out below is intended as a general scale for the LD4PE competency index and will be embodied as a skos:ConceptScheme--each proficiency level denoted by URI. Future, more specialized scales should be mappable to this general scale. <u>The meaning of the individual levels of the scale should be approached as concepts that may be variously labeled throughout the project's development period</u> (i.e., don't get hung up too much on the 'labels' and focus on the propriety of the concepts, knowledge/skills, and professional habits of mind embodied).

The following { DRAFT } proficiency scale is an adaptation of the proficiency scale used by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0">[1]</a></sup>; and, like all things taken out of context and applied differently and elsewhere, the following texts will need additional thinking and refinement.

With regard to a specific competency node, an assigned proficiency level should identify the proficiency level required of the typical learner of this particular competency statement; or, stated differently, this competency is appropriate for typical learners at proficiency level 'x'"

The proficiency level assignment to a node in the LD4PE competency index makes it possible for users to assess the utility of a competency statement to their circumstances (assess/pick) and to gather together competency statements of a given proficiency level (search/browse)--e.g., for a workshop with intermediate level professionals.

Iteratively, as the competency index is developed, we will be surveying the participants on the Editorial Board to evaluate index nodes within their areas of expertise as to their best estimates of the proficiency level of a particular node as well as whether the node's knowledge, skills, and professional habits of mind are "core", "specialized", or "unnecessary" (oops).
