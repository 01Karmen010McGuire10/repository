# Use in Metadata 

The _Exploratorium'_ contains resource descriptions for learning resources (LR) and demonstration datasets (demo data) from both private and public sector entities. If a URL to a license is available it <u>must be included</u> in the resource descriptions to maximize utility to end users. The URL is captured using the following schema.org property:

<pre>schema:license
</pre>

URLs for custom licenses can be used.

The schema.org property expects a URL and <u>not</u> the text of a rights or license statement. If text of a license statement is all that is available, or, access and use requires contacting the owner/publisher, use the following Dublin Core property from the 1.1 namespace to capture that information:

<pre>dc:rights 
</pre>

Since there are no (current) restrictions on whether learning resources with descriptions included in the _Exploratorium_ are free or fee-based, the DC 1.1 property can be used to signal whether the resource has fee or access/use restrictions, contact information etc.

NOTE: Failure to include rights/license information when available <u>significantly reduces the utility of the resource</u>. So, <u>where possible</u>, the goal in describing resources for the _Exploratorium_ is to not leave the end user guessing about rights/use restrictions!
