## How to use OCS 

- [File:Editing Static Pages.pdf](/mediawiki_wiki/files/Editing_Static_Pages.pdf)

### "Conference Managers" 

#### Keep track of registrations 

[File:Manager Stats and Reports.pdf](/mediawiki_wiki/files/Manager_Stats_and_Reports.pdf)

2011-07-05. "Conference Managers" can track registrations. Start by clicking on the "Conference Manager" role link. You will see the list of manager administration functions. About 1/2 way down you'll see the section of functions specific to DC-2011. There are two functions of interest, "Registrations" and "Stats & Reports":

- The Registrations link will take you to the list of all registrants. The column names support sorting. Note that Paid column contains the date of payment and is handled manually since once the link to the PayPal system has been successfully handled, PayPal does not communicate any future transaction data back to the system (e.g., pending transfers etc.). Thus, personnel working directly with the account in PayPal and the bank have to add this final piece of data. This view is brief and does not include all information about a registrant in the system.
- The Stats & Reports link takes you to a set of built-in report options. Near the bottom of the list is a link for Registrants that will download a spreadsheet with full, current data on the registrants.

### Program Committee chairs ( ["track directors"](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2011/trackDirector/)) 

- Assigning reviewers
  - Divide the pool of reviewers among the PC chairs.
  - PC chairs should familiarize themselves with the strengths and weaknesses of each reviewer.
  - PC chairs should assign at least one reviewer from the pool to each paper.
  - Together, the PC chairs should make sure each reviewer has at least two assigned papers.
  - PC chairs should edit the spreadsheet to add reviewer assignments from their pools.
