## Events (Content Type) 

As part of the "ecology watch" activity, participating members (i.e., Drupal authenticated) of the DCMI community submit (calendar) events of interest to DCMI as a whole or to specific DCMI communities and task groups. We don't know the capabilities of existing Drupal modules that might serve DCMI's calendaring needs. There are several factors to be considered in choosing a calendaring module or adapting a module:

1. DCMI is a global community so events will be present in the calendar that take place at locations around the world meaning that a calendaring module needs to be able to handle dates in terms of [time zones](http://drupal.org/node/767182); and
2. The submitter needs to be able to designate the DCMI user group(s) for whom the event might be of interest (see: [Group Types Taxonomy](/index.php?title=DublinToDrupal_Project/EntityTypes&action=edit&redlink=1 "DublinToDrupal Project/EntityTypes (page does not exist)"))

As an initiative committed to metadata best practices, DCMI needs to use existing schema's where ever possible to support interoperability. There are other initiatives out there that have defined event schema; e.g.:

- Schema.org (Bing, Google, Yahoo! and Yandex) at [http://schema.org/Event](http://schema.org/Event)
- LODE: An ontology for Linking Open Descriptions of Events at [http://linkedevents.org/ontology/](http://linkedevents.org/ontology/)
- Etc. etc.
