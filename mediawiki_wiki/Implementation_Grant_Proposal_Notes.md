### "Learning Linked Data II" project concept 

The "Learning Linked Data" project, funded through September 2012 by a one-year IMLS planning grant led by the University of Washington, envisioned an online learning environment in support of educating library and museum professionals in the principles and practice of Linked Data -- a "language lab" of software-supported methods for data processing and analysis. A core project group of twenty instructors, students, and technology experts met to develop an Inventory of Learning Topics. The Inventory, outlining a target set of basic analytical and software skills needed across a wide range of pedagogical contexts, was posted on a blog for input from a larger circle of colleagues. The group concluded that a follow-on project should aim at engaging instructors in a dialogue with software developers to match analytical tasks with specific software tools in order to provide instructors and students with a well-organized and carefully documented collection of video microtutorials.

Specific pedagogical approaches, along with the audiences for which they were tailored, were therefore considered to be out of scope for the Inventory of Learning Topics. Moreover, it was felt that any particular syllabus offered by the project would inevitably need to be customized for a diverse range of instructional goals and instructor preferences and would, in complex ways, go quickly out of date.

#### "Language lab," or "kitchen"? 

The collection of software-supported methods to be provided by the project was seen as providing a "palette" of functionality from which instructors could draw in realizing particular course concepts. An alternative metaphor of a "kitchen" was proposed, describing the challenge in terms of equipping a workspace with utensils that would allow cooks to prepare a wide range of "courses."

Looking at Stuart's distinctions between "supporting resources" (or "components"), "learning outcomes", and "learning trajectories" in terms of the LLD II concept:

- We have produced an Inventory of Learning Topics, the Topics of which underlie the Outcomes. As far as I can tell, Outcomes are Topics related to a measurable set of expectations, expressed with verbs (my definition) - they connect Topics with pedagogical goals related specifically to those Topics.
- Should we focus on creating tutorial materials specifically about software tools used to get learners from Learning Topics to Learning Outcomes, or should we focus more broadly on defining Learning Topics in the area of Linked Data (for libraries and museums), without focusing too much on software tools per se?

The expected users of the LLD II project results fall into three broad categories:

- Working professionals seeking to solve problems on-the-job.
- Students seeking formal qualification.
- Instructors, faculty, or consultants who need to teach either of the above.

Possibilities for the "kitchen" metaphor:

- Learning Outcomes are things that people should know how to do: Slice-and-Dice, Dress-a-Turkey, Knead-Bread... Learning Trajectories are like "recipes" that put learning outcomes into a specific sequence in order to prepare some specific dish. For Linked Data, alot of these Learning Outcomes will be about using tools, just like in a kitchen alot of the techniques are about using cooking utensils: bread hooks, chef knives, garlic presses... Instead of providing a Julia Childs or Jamie Oliver tutorial on baking a turkey, we will aim at providing tutorials on individual steps, like slicing-and-dicing, kneading.

### Project concept, defined narrowly 

Taking the Inventory of Learning Topics as a point of departure, the project will identify, under each topic, specific analytical tasks -- tasks, the accomplishment of which could be taught, using existing software, in the form of brief, screencast-based microtutorials. The process of identifying such specific tasks will be undertaken in an open community of instructors and interested learners, anchored in a metadata community of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. Well-specified tasks will provide concrete reference points for recruiting software developers to provide microtutorials targeted on the use of their own tools.

The end result of the project will be a set of microtutorials, each focused on a specific task, organized under an evolving set of Learning Topics and Sub-Topics. Instructors and learners would draw on this "palette" of tasks in designing specific courses, selecting and sequencing the possibilities differently according to the background and needs of their students. By developing a publication channel for microtutorials with well-practiced workflows, and anchored in an ongoing metadata community, this effort could be undertaken in a way that could prove to be sustainable beyond the end of the project.

In order to do this in manner sustainable as an ongoing activity, the project will work with DCMI to create a community of LLD instructors and learners for identifying the tasks, identify a pool of open-source developers interested in reaching the DCMI community with documentation on how to use their tools, and a define an efficient workflow for creating the microtutorials.

We will assign URIs to Topics, making them potentially magnets for links to "Resources". Developing navigational structures through DCMI learning lab resources that build on RDF, provide a means for others to link into it.

### Ideas 

- People like the idea of "playable" examples.
- Enable discovery or relating of instructional units and supporting resources based on what learners accomplish (Outcomes) with respect to a Topic.
- Google Faculty Summit 2012 at [https://sites.google.com/site/facultysummit2012/](https://sites.google.com/site/facultysummit2012/)
- The "learning triangle"
  - 1) learning outcomes;
  - 2) learning resources that provide the means to those outcomes; and
  - 3) assessments to determine whether the outcomes have been reached.
  - Educators speak of the "tight coupling" of these three **and** an information space where "tight coupling" can be expressed. This could be done in DCMI's Learning Lab.
- "micro-tutorials": short tutorials about very specific analytical tasks. LLD II could focus on basic analytical and implementation skills as "building blocks" that could be fitted into broader pedagogical concepts.
- Framing Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) as an information space.
  - Note that the LOS approach is being implemented successfully in K-12; Gates follows this approach in investing for US education.
- A DCMI Community (or Learning Lab) of faculty members could layer Outcomes over Topics... - also trajectories.
- Learning Trajectories involve the tailored scoping and sequencing of discrete units of instruction. They are pedagogical structures.
- When teachers/trainers look for resources, seek resources that achieve learning goals expressed as learning outcomes (not "topics").
- The [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) is an instructional website based on the idea that learners learn more effectively when they can view videos at their own pace, and that this actually frees up instructors to spend more of their time with students (as opposed to lecturing and grading papers). Teachers report that they "assign lectures as homework and what used to be homework is now done in the classroom".
- There is a great [TED Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gM95HHI4gLk) about the Khan Academy, at the end of which Bill Gates appears, calling it a glimpse of the "future of education". I believe he (or the Foundation) has given funding to the Khan Academy, which operates as a non-profit.
- Dan Brickley pointed us to a [really stunning tutorial on writing program code](http://www.khanacademy.org/cs/intro-to-animation/830742281). The really jaw-dropping part of this environment, for me, is that you can actually stop the tutorial anywhere along the video time-line, EDIT THE CODE in the left-hand pane, and view the results immediately in the right-hand pane. I envision tutorials on that explain how to use some ten-line Python or Ruby scripts to explore a Linked Data dataset, where you can actually stop the tutorial and play with the code.
- Having a split-screen interface allowing users to tweak code in one box and see results in another raises the prospect of being able to teach, say, a small and controlled set of Ruby or Python commands, or SPARQL queries, for exploring Linked Data.
- I'm wondering if we might go one step further and approach the Khan Academy about partnering in this venture. In effect, we would be asking IMLS to fund the community-based platform and process for specifying the content of our microtutorials and for engaging instructors with software developers, and we would look to the Khan Academy as a channel for disseminating content and for infrastructural support for creating code-based (and other types of) tutorials. I'm thinking it would be ideal if our content could somehow be branded by IMLS (through our project), DCMI, and Khan Academy.
- David: I remember a lot of reaction and discussion among some teacher friends about a year ago, not all of it positive. They described the videos and the play-rewind-replay sequence that highlight that program as an online form of classic sage-on-the-stage lecturing with assessment based on skill drills. A lot of that criticism is summed up well (in my opinion, anyway) in a blog post [1] by a physics teacher who has backed up his comments with some videos of his own [discussed in 2] that do a better job (according to him). I agree with some of those critiques, but I do think the animation tutorial you linked [3] definitely moves beyond skill drills and presents an interesting model that might be really useful for LLD. For example, an instructional video component might be a great addition to the RDFa tool [4] you linked in another email; I love the interaction built into the option to toggle between graph and data views as the code is edited!
- Describing paths through the maps could be a function of the community. Sort of like "play lists" for the short "songs" we will provide.
- "At what level of granularity should these LLD outcomes (or topics) be defined?" Obviously, they cannot be too broad and generic without being meaningless. Nor, however, should they be too defined too narrowly.
  - Stuart: Tom, this matter of granularity of outcome is something that is technically accommodated by the ASN. The process is called "unpacking" by some (teachers) and "deconstruction" by others dealing with formally stated outcomes that are insufficiently granular for particular needs. The Gates Foundation has just funded work a consortium of CCSSO, PARCC, SBAC and SETDA (\*State Educational Technology Directors Association)\*\* \*to develop finer-grained outcomes for the new U.S. Common Core State Standards. This is necessary because learning outcomes are frequently written in a more general manner than useful in all cases. For example, consider the following (imaginary) learning objective: "Students will be able to tie their shoe laces and fly a kite." A publisher creating assessment instruments to measure this outcome will need to break this into two more refined assertions: "Students are able to tie their shoe laces" and "Students are abe to fly a kite" because they would be assessed by different instruments. Within the ASN framework, that publisher simply creates the two derived RDF ASN assertions (with URI in the publisher's namespace) and appropriately relates them (mapping predicate) to the original outcome being unpacked. They are simply two new ASN "statements" (of an outcome + related metadata) however with different provenance (i.e., the publisher who created them).
- We cannot answer this question in the abstract, but we can frame Phase I of the LLD II Project as being about defining those outcomes (or topics) and assigning URIs to those outcomes as magnets for links from supporting resources.

### Ideas from Stuart 

- Stuart: The LOS notion provides the information framework for a learning lab context to house and make "tutorials specifically about software tools in support of learning" available in a way people needing these materials think about the problem. So you have this pile of tutorials based on the modular principle you'be been playing with (and things like the Khan Academy and Coursera are playing with)--then what. Over time--like we see in the short histories of Coursera and Khan Academy--you end up with a giant, giant pile of stuff. Look at the Khan Academy [browse of math topics/subtopics](http://www.khanacademy.org/#browse). Actually only marginally useful without lots and lots of poking around. The kind of time consuming poking around that people don't have. It is not useful to have such a pile if all you've got going in terms of context is topical buckets with potentially hundreds of resources in a bucket. People teaching/training think in terms of topics only to get into the right buckets. Then they are focused on what is to be achieved. LOS targets what is to be achieved. Also, topics+LOS focuses future developers of areas in a learning lab. E.g., assume that DCMI folk are interested in developing instruction/training in NKOS. How can this LLD work inform how that would be shaped? Topics>>Learning Outcome>>Resource (tools, instructional modules, supporting materials, assessment instruments etc.) seems like a solid path.
- Stuart: this thread around embodying the LLD learning outcomes in RDF as ell as the potential uses is something that partner JES & Co. can bring to the table including the already existing infrastructure and expertise. We can even play out the scenario even further. The iSchool already has courses that are looking at the linked data underpinning--e.g., RDF etc.--and having community defined learning outcomes would make it possible to align existing course and workshops etc. to the outcomes as well as tools and services mapped by others.
- Stuart: We should consider making a "machine representation" of the LLD learning topics/outcomes we have tentatively developed. This is not an area where we have to "invent" infrastructure to create the respresentation. The framework for such description already exists in RDF with the the ASN work, currently funded by the Gates Foundation. The reason I think that this is key, is that the maps I spoke of below are actually best thought of as mappings of learning outcomes that have building blocks correlated (mapped) to them. So the base of the map is actually the outcomes to be achieved and their relationships to other outcomes in a particular map. The \_very primitive\_ NSDL Science Literacy Maps [1], using AAAS Benchmarks for Science Literacy, are a very basic example of how a learning trajectory (Netherlands)/strand map (U.S.) can be used. The example shows a set of learning outcomes that have been mapped into a meaningful learning structure \_and\_ learning resources (lesson plans, videos, exercises etc.) have been mapped to those learning outcomes nodes in the map.
- If we do a machine representation of our LLD outcomes in RDF and publish them to the linked data cloud, then other LD tool makers beyond the project can begin mapping their tools to the outcomes.
- Stuart: A [very brief video](http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/tutorials/InfoBubble/) shows how the NSDL implementation works. Now, note that all of this is hand-crafted (because NSDL is functionally brain dead). BUT, imagine if the learning outcomes nodes in the AAAS Benchmarks for Science Literacy strand maps all had URI and were available in RDF (and in the linked data cloud). Guess what, they are! Check out [the following](http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/D2365735) at ASN.
- The key is that the glue of the map is the machine readable/addressable learning outcome to which all else is mapped (e.g., pedagogical packages).
- Stuart: In DropBox, see /RESOURCES/Sutton-EdReNe-2011-05-18a-2.pptx. It's a bit outdated by gives a sense of how the ASN framework works. 
- Differentiate between the "building blocks" (e.g., micro-tutorials) to be provided by LLD II and the "pedagogical packages" that might be built with those blocks.
- ASN: learning outcoms as building blocks and curricula as pedagogical packages. Curriculum in the IMS sense is a "scope and sequence" matter with a set of learning resources and accompanying outcomes. The result is MAP made up of a sequencing of learning units/components into various meaningful structures that make up curriculum (even personally tailored curriculum). These meaningful structures are called different things in different parts of the world. E.g., skeletal "strand maps" (AAAS) in the U.S., "learning trajectories" in the Netherlands and on and on and on. Bottom line, curriculum and a sequenced learner portfolio of units learned are all simply mappings among nodes. In the Kahn TED talk you see a variation of such maps in his discussion of the Los Altos school district. The ASN mapping tool for example can create such maps with appropriate mapping predicates. It is this kind of mapping functionality that sits behind every application and app claiming to be a "curriculum builder". IMS has a whole suite of standards specifications dealing with this stuff. Being able to flexibly structure such maps is at the heart of individual leaning plans and behind the massive data load that has made such individuation unreasonable...until now.
- Stuart: That said, I do not see the LLD environment prescribing the paths through such maps...i.e., not actually prescribing curriculum but rather enabling the building (and even sharing) of such maps.

### 2012-08-22 David talks with Randy Orwin 

Randy Orwin spent time with me today to offer his expertise in tools for providing online instruction. He had a lot of great suggestions and raised some issues I hadn't considered, which I'll summarize below. I'm copying Randy so he can correct anything I misunderstood about our discussion or insert points that I forget to mention.

- Timing is a little tough for LLD, because standards are shifting now away from Flash (the easy default choice until rather recently) toward methods native to HTML5. Flash would be a particularly problematic choice if our audience wanted to access LLD content on iPad or various Mac devices, and that's likely to be the case.
- Many instructors, who are the core LLD audience, are enthusiastic early adopters of tablet devices on various platforms with various capabilities, including iPad, flavors of Android OS, differing media player apps, etc. It will be important to present content in a very standard way to allow access across so many devices.
- We can expect to have more control over authoring tools used to create LLD tutorials to achieve that standard output. Options include client software installed on the machines of contractors who would create tutorials and web-based systems that can gather the input and generate the output in our desired format. Even the web-based tools typically install some small bits of client utilities to control the microphone and maybe other functions of the content-creator's system.
- Flash is commonly used for those utility functions by web-based authoring tools, but we can expect it to persist long enough and be available to our content authors, so its demise won't prevent us from using those tools over the 2-year time horizon of the LLD implementation project. This isn't the major concern for authoring that it is for user access to LLD content. 
- LLD can either stream the video tutorials or make them available just as files to be accessed and potentially saved locally by users. If content licensing terms will allow free saving and sharing of these media files, that might be the cheaper, easier, and overall better choice.
- Streaming would require uploading media to a server set up in the final hosting environment. Options are Adobe Media Server and potentially open source options like Kaltura. This option would entail ongoing costs for server and streaming software maintenance, but with advantages in quick display and control of content (e.g., preventing local saving of media files, if desired).
- Overall, Randy recommends a display architecture for the media tutorials based on HTML5 with common media player tools to display MP4 files (which are very standard now and likely to remain so). Drupal provides strong tools for managing media elements, including simple uploads with automatic creation of player skins to control display of the MP4s. This is LLD's best shot at presenting content for easy access across multiple devices.

David: I'll share a few more thoughts based on my recently completed distance-learning experience. Recorded lectures were key parts of most of my online classes, mostly slides with voiceover, and they were helpful overall. Some variance resulted from instructors' implementation styles, but I think the type of material to be covered was a more important determinant of how effective the recorded lectures were. Another source of variation in success is student learning style, and I'm a good example. I am \*not\* an auditory learner who picks up information reliably via lecture, even with effective video/animation as a backup. Reading is a much more successful approach for me, especially with opportunities to discuss readings (a key strength of my UW online learning experience) and with important reinforcement form practice exercises and other assigned hand-ins. I say all this to underscore a need for different packages of learning resources rather than relying too much on a single delivery mode. The more diverse a set of resources LLD can provide to instructors, the better it will support them in crafting effective coursework.

### Notes 

**ASN PPT**

- ASN provides a comprehensive structure for local curriculum description that retains potential to connect with related curricula from other contexts and to adapt to varying sets of needs.
- Central goal is a clear statement of a learning outcome to be achieved through instruction.
- "Atomization takes place at the level of the source ‘publication’" [slide 8]. Needs clarification?
- [slide 13] Good, so \*which\* CVs? This is a core question, but may be answered only by attrition & survival of the fittest over time??
- The real power would come from ability to select from existing samples of SLOs rather than minting new ones (???)
- Huge benefit of this approach for LLD: It would model a Linked Data process for the work. Failure to eat one's own dog food is always a serious blow to credibility. Given that a Linked Data approach exists (or >1?), could the project NOT adopt it??

**URI document**

- _Very_ wordy synthesis of a few key ideas. Probably seems concise and workable to academics (?) but potentially intimidating to noobs (e.g., me). LLD must do something similar, but with less verbiage and more clarity of 'story arc.' Less explanation, more examples!
- Rubric on p. 4 sums up the whole doc in half a page.

'_LOS command words_

- List of 30 action verbs to anchor learning outcome statements
- How closely does this match other lists (e.g., top of p. 3 in the URI document)?

**Machine-Readable Curriculum (Ward and Nicholas)**

- "in the short to medium term, jurisdictional curricula will co-exist with the national curriculum." (p. 1). In the long term, jurisdictional curricula will adapt national (other larger jurisdiction)? Uniform adoption is unlikely across U.S., at least, but some sort of telescoping broader/narrower structure might be a stable long-term model.
- Primary benefit is to present a list of well-described learning RESOURCES to which instructors could map their own learning outcomes and strands, thus innoculating LLD against the risk of articulating and maintaining curricula. e.g., point 4, top of p. 2.
- With that said, should LLD consider articulating outcomes as well as resources? How can it identify the best resources out of context of the key outcomes? Possibly what's left to instructors is to articulate the strands. (p. 5)
- What about assessment? It's tied to outcomes, so if LLD defines outcomes, would it then need to define assessments? Or can that be lumped with the strands and left to the instructors?
- Does LLD need to explicitly articulate a change mgmt scheme? (p. 6)

**Sutton-Golder 2008**

- 3.1 -- Correlations. This seems to be a core function of LLD if it adopts an ASN model -- characterize resources such that they can be correlated unambiguously to appropriate learning objectives. How to do that without the objectives already articulated? Developments since 2008? This is especially problematic with less-than-optimal correlation.
- Cite NSF grant as prior work contributing to LLD? Might help demonstrate continuity in the funding networks.
