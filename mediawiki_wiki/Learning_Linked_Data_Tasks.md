# Tasked-Structured Learning 

Some learners are best motivated, and best learn, when working towards practical goals -- specific tasks. Assuming Linked Data is not an end in itself, but a means to an end, this list addresses the "why" of learning Linked Data -- practical ends and advantages to be gained from using LD. Documentation may be categorized as:

- tutorial (suited to pure beginners)
- procedural (for practitioners learning to meet functional needs supported by a system)
- reference (for experienced users who need to look up particular details). 

At least the last two categories meet highly task-focused needs of learners with specific scopes of activity in mind.[1] Learners very frequently engage with documentation in a nonlinear fashion,[2] browsing for answers to specific functional questions that restore their ability to act.[3]

[KarenC proposes](http://dublincore.org/pipermail/learninglinkeddata/2012-January/000045.html) that we ensure that everything in the [Inventory of Learning Objectives](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data_Inventory.md) is needed for a task, and that everything in the tasks is covered by the inventory. Karen notes that in continuing education in the library field, learners need to be able to go back to their library and do something with what they have learned -- and do something before they've forgotten what they learned, and that classes get slammed if they don't provide a good, practical outcome for the learners. This differs from classroom learning because students in classrooms expect a delay between learning and practice.

## Defining a Metadata Project 

- Analysis of goals and requirements
- Determination of data model
  - entities and relationships
    - the triple structure
    - things and strings
    - identifiers (URIs)
- Exercise: create a data model (giving a few options, like for a warehouse, for a car dealership)
- Stuart: A full-blown "language [of description design] lab" would have _accessible_ (intellectually and otherwise) learning resources to support all the necessary knowledge and skills to function in the context of RDF as set out in DCMI Singapore Framework (i.e., using it as an instructional framework/process model)

## Defining your metadata as classes and properties 

- classes
  - what's a class, what is it for?
  - when to use a class and when a property?
  - where to find classes you can use, and what this means in terms of the rest of your metadata
  - introduction to OWL classes and common usage
- properties
  - where to find useful properties
  - how to know if you can use a property you have found
  - adding constraints to properties
  - making relationships between properties
- introduction to some useful re-usable metadata
  - FOAF
  - BIBO
  - BIO
  - DBPedia
  - Umbel
  - ....

[dih: Is there a reason why the RDA Vocabularies aren't included in this list?]

- Exercise: Select classes and properties for your data

## Expressing existing databases or knowledge organization systems in RDF 

- Expressing thesauri and classification systems in SKOS
- Expressing descriptive schemas (and standards) in RDF
- Migrating databases from traditional formats into RDF-compatible formats
- Extracting RDF triples from non-RDF-based datasets

## Values and vocabularies 

- Data types (RDF, OWL)
- Using controlled lists of terms
  - SKOS

## Creating a database 

- DB tools for triples

## Querying data 

## Connecting to the Web of data 

## Analyzing the characteristics of datasets 

- Provenance of data
- What the dataset is about
- Triple Patterns
