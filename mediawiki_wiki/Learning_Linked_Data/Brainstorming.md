## Brainstorming 

### Language Lab (Project) Assumptions 

- Stuart: It seems to me that we need to get "assumptions" out on the table regarding the characteristics of the learners of interest. Those of us on faculties in iSchools get graduate/undergraduate(?) students that range from the computer science student to students with graduate degrees in the arts (I was theatre arts graduate lacking any technical skills). A useful "language [of description design] lab" should enable the learner to start where they 'are'. This will affect what is decided about what they need to learn and how they can best learn.

- Stuart: Is this "language [of description design] lab" intended as a "one-off" with existence and support only during the IMLS implementation grant period or is it to be maintained and evolve?

### What Needs to be Learned? 

- Stuart: A full-blown "language [of description design] lab" would have _accessible_ (intellectually and otherwise) learning resources to support all the necessary knowledge and skills to function in the context of RDF as set out in DCMI Singapore Framework (i.e., using it as an instructional framework/process model)

</dd></dl>

- Craig: If we enable the learner to start where they are, should we provide grounding in foundational concepts and technologies? For example
  - Web foundations (W3C standards process, HTTP, URL, URI, etc).
  - XML, XML Schema, and XML-based languages
  - Data models, modeling, and schema (including UML, ER, object, hierarchical, graph)
  - Query languages (SQL, SPARQL, XPath)
  - Standards bodies and processes
  - Authority, and vocabulary management
  - Primers on sets and graphs and why they're important for the web; primer on formal semantics

### How it Might Be Learned 

#### Tools that help learning 

- Marcia: design an interactive decision making tool to guide people in [choosing a metadata property](http://aims.fao.org/lode/bd/rights), perhaps on the model of NPR's flowchart for [choosing a science fiction book](http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/flowchart-for-navigating-nprs-top-100-sff-books/).

- Marcia: NSDL [Science Literacy Maps [http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/](http://strandmaps.nsdl.org/)]

NSDL Science Literacy Maps are a tool for teachers and students to find resources that relate to specific science and math concepts. The maps illustrate connections between concepts as well as how concepts build upon one another across grade levels. Clicking on a concept within the maps will show NSDL resources relevant to the concept, as well as information about related AAAS Project 2061 Benchmarks and National Science Education Standards.

- Craig: For a hands-on-lab
  - Domain modeling tools, perhaps RDF-independent?
  - Access to a pool of existing vocabularies
  - Tools for creating new vocabularies, properties, and classes
  - An environment for publishing new vocabularies (e.g., the ability to mind your own URIs)
  - Tools for composing application profiles from existing vocabularies
  - Tools for creating concrete implementations/records
  - Tools to ingest into a database/store -- perhaps legacy (e.g., RDB) and triple
  - An environment for query/retrieval
  - Ample examples and best practices

- Craig: Tools should have a lower barrier of entry. More technical students can always dig deeper.
- KarenW: Examples using FOAF profiles might be a good place to start, as the vocabulary is simple and might be fairly easy for a general audience to engage with. I was recently looking around at the FOAF project site ( [http://www.foaf-project.org/](http://www.foaf-project.org/)) and found FOAF-a-Matic ( [http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic](http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic)), which lets you build a FOAF profile for yourself with a web form. So that's a possible way to get learners to be engaged with creating linked data themselves pretty quickly.
