### Project Links 

- [Project home](/mediawiki_wiki/Learning_Linked_Data.md)

This page represents one possible way of presenting use cases for Linked Data instruction highlighting instructional priorities of each.

### Introductory University Course 

From Stuart Sutton: Introductory university course in semantic metadata. Emphasis would have to span all learning categories, with coverage at a general level in each.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**

### Museum Metadata Publication and Exchange 

From David Talley: Museum interested in exposing collection descriptions as semantic metadata. Emphasis needed on conceptual understanding, creating/manipulating RDF, and implementing an application.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
  - Rationale for Linked Data
  - Open World assumption
  - URIs as identifiers
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
  - Domain modeling
  - Deriving Linked Data from other formats, analysis of partially structured or unstructured text
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**
  - Establishing/maintaining a triple store
  - Establishing/maintaining a SPARQL endpoint
  - ### Academic Publication Repository and Author Profile 

DT: Is 'profile' a good term for this? From Laura Smart: Small academic research library wants to expose faculty names as Linked Data incorporating resources from an institutional repository, researcher expertise/scholar profile applications (ex. VIVO, Community of Science), grant applications, publication tracking and metrics (esp. for institutional impact/sharing at the provost level). Emphasis on creating/manipulating and on searching/querying, with coverage of implementing an application.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**

### Merge Records in Multiple Formats 

From Corey Harper: Merge MARC, EAD, and Dublin Core records into "NYU Core" records. Taking five records, extracting parts of them to triples, merging those into a graph, and turning that into a record. Strong emphasis on creating/manipulating RDF.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**

### Format-agnostic Organizational Information Systems 

From Joseph Busch: A corporate problem would be that they can't efficiently get the data they need because it's dispersed in all these different places. An instructional goal is to get their data management people to stop doing 'data management' and think about how their data should be made Linked Data ready without building another system. Emphasis on conceptual understanding, possibly with coverage of visualization.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**

### Discovery of Related Resources 

From Marjorie Hlava: A science association might have journals, conferences, committees, etc. on a topic. Someone discovers an article and wants to link out to related things in different formats or venues via web links, possibly in search results. Emphasis on visualization and maybe automated searching/querying.

- **Understanding Linked Data**
- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**

### Retention Scheduling for Organizational Records 

From Marjorie Hlava: A large insurance company spends US$1 million annually to store 2 terabytes of undifferentiated data. It needs to set a retention schedule and link it via a controlled vocabulary applied by a crawling mechanism to every information object, while respecting legal holds that force variations from schedules. Emphasis on searching/querying but also on creating/manipulating RDF.

- **Searching and querying Linked Data**
- **Creating and manipulating RDF**
- **Visualization**
- **Implementing a Linked Data application**
