## Brief abstract (50 words max.) 

The panel will report on the [Learning Linked Data project](http://lld.ischool.uw.edu/wp/) aimed at planning and implementing an integrated "language lab" to support the teaching of metadata design for the Linked Data environment. It will explore essential questions, embedded in use cases, driving selection and organization of technologies and instructional resources.

## Extended abstract 

The spread of Semantic Web applications increasingly links separate knowledge repositories from multiple providers, including libraries, museums, archives, and other cultural memory institutions, so that each extends and provides context for the others. This activity presents a substantial challenge to libraries, in particular, as they move toward exposing their rich legacy of data – catalog records, authority files (e.g., VIAF), thesauri and classification schemes, and all forms of contextual resource description – as Linked Data. Successful implementation makes libraries' authoritative data available and discoverable through cross-referencing and rich interlinking with related sources of information outside the library walls, thereby extending the reach and impact of library data in the wider context of the Web and pulling into the library environment rich supporting resources from elsewhere.

Learning Linked Data is a project, funded by an IMLS Planning grant, aimed at bootstrapping the creation of an integrated learning resource to support the teaching of metadata design for the Linked Data environment in both university and professional training contexts. In effect, the project seeks to create a "language lab" for learners and designers of Languages of Description on the Semantic Web. The project focuses on a limited but crucial aspect of the problem of moving libraries into the Linked Data space: that of providing faculty and professional trainers with a set of instructional resources for teaching the methods and practices of Linked Data to the new generation of librarians and information professionals.

The Learning Linked Data resources will help instructors understand how best to teach the principles and practices of exposing and accessing Linked Data. It will present selected open-source software components, integrating them into a unified environment, and providing documentation to guide their effective use. Definition of critical instructional components will be driven by requirements deriving from an analysis of essential knowledge and methods students will need to master in order to interpret Linked Data and create effective applications. Those requirements emerge from use cases covering a wide range from highly specific and task-focused to general research within a topic or even across topics. The Learning Linked Data project must articulate use cases, then derive specific component tasks incorporated within them.

Use cases incorporate the questions that the Learning Linked Data resources will be designed to answer for instructors and learners. Once articulated, those questions provide the criteria for selection among the highly variable constellation of tools available for working with Linked Data and their configuration to meet specific instructional needs.

Panelists will report on the Learning Linked Data project. Led by faculty from the University of Washington iSchool, the project involves partnership commitments from Kent State University, with Marcia Zeng as lead, and the University of North Carolina, represented by Jane Greenberg. In addition to named panelists, participants in the project's initial work included a number of experienced individuals: Diane Hillmann of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, library software developers Corey Harper of New York University and Ed Summers of the Library of Congress, and independent consultants Karen Coyle, Marjorie Hlava, and Joseph Busch, among others. Each participant brought experience teaching courses and seminars to mid-career professionals based on deep knowledge of library standards and an up-to-date grasp of technological solutions.

Panelists will recount a 2-day seminar held in Seattle on February 2-3, 2012 that provided the starting point for development of the project. Participants met to brainstorm and discuss the Learning Linked Data program, and the panel's discussion will detail the tools identified as candidates for inclusion in the project's instructional resource set. Panelists will explain the categories into which the tools were gathered:

- Understanding Linked Data
- Searching and querying Linked Data
- Creating and manipulating RDF
- Visualization
- Implementing a Linked Data application

They will recall the discussion of the instructional goals guiding applications of the tools and report on a process of public review in which materials developed during the February seminar were posted online and comments were gathered from librarians, educators, consultants, practitioners, and other interested parties worldwide.

Finally, panelists will look ahead to a proposed 2-year implementation phase beginning in 2013 in which the planning funded and undertaken so far will guide development of a coherent collection of instructional tools and documentation about their use available to facilitate learning and instruction about Linked Data applications. Throughout, the presentations will emphasize the emergence and clarification of questions that define the instructional context around Linked Data to guide categorization of tools and instructional resources and detail the use cases the project's instructional resources will be configured to serve. The panel will present a useful opportunity to extend and elaborate on the public comment period that followed the February seminar by inviting questions and suggestions from attendees as well as active discussion with panelists. In this way, the panel will help to inform attendees about new resources in support of Linked Data instruction while refining questions to be answered by project implementation to ensure that the resulting resources provide direct and effective answers for teachers and learners.

## Project Bios 

[Michael Crandall](http://ischool.uw.edu/faculty/mikecran) has extensive industry experience with metadata implementation and software, as well as being a founding member of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Oversight Committee and a frequent speaker at conferences on metadata and information organization. He is currently Chair of the Information School’s Master of Science in Information Management Program.

[Thomas Baker](http://dublincore.org/about/executive/#baker) participated as Research Manager and thought partner in the project. Dr. Baker is currently Chief Information Officer of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and Chair of the DCMI Usage Board, the committee for maintaining DCMI's standards, such as DCMI Metadata Terms. He was the co-chair of the W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group.

[Joseph Tennis](http://ischool.uw.edu/faculty/jtennis) focuses his research on classification theory. He evaluates classification practices and structures with attention to changes in systems over time, comparisons among them when diverse design requirements are invoked by different communities, and their interoperation in the web environment. He is Assistant Professor in the University of Washington iSchool, where he earned the Ph.D. degree.

[Stuart Sutton](http://ischool.uw.edu/faculty/sasutton)’s research areas include metadata and networked information discovery and retrieval, technology-mediated teaching and learning, and the law and policy of intellectual property. He continues to teach as Associate Professor Emeritus in the University of Washington's iSchool, while also serving as CEO of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.

[Marcia Zeng](http://faculty-l.slis.kent.edu/~mzeng/) brings to the project many years of experience teaching metadata design at Kent State University's School of Library and Information Science and educational events at professional associations in various countries. She has been very active for many years in the broader community engaged in metadata and knowledge organization systems standards and best practice guidelines. She is Director-at-large of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T).

[David Talley](http://www.preciserecall.com/lisprofession/) has completed requirements for the MLIS degree from the University of Washington iSchool. He came to that program with 10 years' experience as Enterprise Content Architect for a professional association serving engineers and scientists in water supplies and treatment, which followed nearly 20 years of editorial work focused on technical and college-level instructional materials.
