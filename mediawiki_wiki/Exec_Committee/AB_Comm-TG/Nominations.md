# Nominations Committee 

_**[mz]:** To differentiate from the OC Nominations Committee, should we name it as AB-Nominations Committee?_

_**[ss]:** Do we really need two committees for chair/chair-elect of AB and OC ... or one?_

_**[jb]:** I agree with Stuart. We should have a single Nominating Committeee._

_**[mz]:** I agree too._
