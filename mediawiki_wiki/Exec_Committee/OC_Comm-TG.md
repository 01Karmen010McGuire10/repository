# Oversight Committee 

## (Current) Charter 

The DCMI Board establishes an Oversight Committee that advises on operational, strategic and other issues and exercises voting privileges in the governance of DCMI. The Oversight Committee is comprised of: (1) Regional Members, (2) Independent Members (individuals appointed by the Board), and (3) Institutional Members. In all matters, the Oversight Committee establishes equitable procedures for its decision-making. While most activities in DCMI are consensus based, certain formal actions are subject to formal voting. The common rule for voting within DCMI is that proposals need more than 50% of assigned votes in favor and less than 25% of assigned votes against. Given the global nature of DCMI, where formal voting is required, electronic balloting is preferred.

## Committees 

The Oversight Committee has two standing committees:

- Membership & Finance
- Nominations & Bylaws

OC Members are expected to serve as active members of at least one OC committee. The incoming OC Chair shall appoint/renew the appointment of chairs of OC Committees In consultation with the OC Chair-Elect, OC Chair shall appoint/renew the appointment of the members of OC Committees.
