The highlights of the organizational changes include:

1.  

Renaming the Oversight Committee to the Governing Board, to recognize the increased responsibility it is taking on as the Directorate steps back into a supporting role with reduced funding. This is in line with the comments that were raised in the OC committee in Lisbon, and makes the role of the board more explicit as the primary decision making body for the organization.

2.  

Elevating the Usage Board to more prominence in the governing structure as the primary technical body responsible for the continued maintenance and development of DCMI standards and architecture. This body will have an expanded role and a voice in the governance structure through a seat on the Executive Committee.

3.  

Establishing an Executive Committee comprised of the officers of the three primary governing bodies in the new organization, which will provide overall guidance to the directorate, with the approval and input of the three bodies in their discussions. The purpose of this committee is to allow routine decisions to be made without full convening of the respective bodies, but in no way removes the authority of those bodies, since all decisions must be vetted by their membersâ€”the presumption is that the officers of the bodies will maintain communication with each group and make sure that any decisions taken have full approval and knowledge of the respective body at all time (as in this message to you).

4.  

Formalizing standing committees under each body, and providing an ongoing mechanism for electing officers for the committees through policy and procedures (to be developed once the structure has been approved). This includes the establishment of two committees on the Governing Board, Membership & Finance and Nominations & Bylaws, to be chaired respectively by the Chair-elect and Past Chair of the Board. Members of the Governing Board will be expected to serve on one of these committees each year, to ensure that the ongoing operations of DCMI are properly managed.

5.  

Close liaison between the Usage Board and the Specifications/Documentation committee under the Advisory Board, through ex-officio membership on the UB of the chair of the AB committee. The purpose of setting up these two separate bodies is to resolve the long-standing perception of the Usage Board as a blocker to community development, by making a clear demarcation between the core standards DCMI supports internationally, and providing a place where community specifications can be developed and made public for use by others.
