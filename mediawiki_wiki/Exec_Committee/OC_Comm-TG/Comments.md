  - **Comment:** How many members are you assuming for each of the standing committees?
    - **Comment Permalink:** [https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DC-OC;7473409c.1312](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DC-OC;7473409c.1312)
  - **Response:** [Mike C.] That has not been discussed, but for the Advisory Board committees, I suspect that the size will be limited by the interest and availability of the members. In the Governing Board, since we have a small number of members at the present time, I would expect each board member to belong to one of the committees, making each of the two committees five people (including the committee chair) with our current board membership. As the size of the Governing Board grows (through new members), this may need to be adjusted-- this will be addressed in the bylaws and policies and procedures.

  - **Comment:** I'm assuming two standing committees under GB, and four under AB. Is this correct?

  - **Response:** [Mike C.] As currently proposed, this is correct. If other needs are identified, more committees could be proposed- we would need to define a process for that in the policies and procedures that the Executive Committee will be composing over the coming months.

  - **Comment:** Do Task Groups and Committees have to prepare reports to each of the boards (UB, AB, GB)? Or, do the boards share reports from them?
    - **Comment Permalink:** [https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DC-OC;7473409c.1312](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=DC-OC;7473409c.1312)
  - **Response:** [Mike C.] We haven't discussed this-- questions like this will be addressed in the policies and procedures. But my initial answer would be that the committees would prepare reports for the board that they are responsible to; these would then be shared as appropriate with the other boards by the chairs through the Executive Committee.

  - **Comment:** Thanks for this. The structure looks promising given the past history and current environment of DCMI. I am only a little concerned about the number of people required by this structure. I'm sure that will sort itself out, but we might think proactively about how we will motivate and incentivize participation in all of these different groupings. ¶Also, I will go hunting for this to see if I missed it, but I will need clarification on the specifics of the relationship between GB and ASIST. I have some assumptions, but I need to bring myself up to speed on what has been decided and what is still in formation.

  - **Response:** [Mike C.] Joe, thanks for your comments—you can find information about the relationship of DCMI and ASIS&T here: [http://dublincore.org/about/reshaping/](http://dublincore.org/about/reshaping/). Stuart points out that oversight by ASIS&T is based on risk avoidance (fiscal risk or risk to ASIS&T 501(c)(3) status). Other than these two areas, they consider DCMI to be an independent operating entity and have no oversight of our operations. ¶After reviewing, if you are satisfied that the proposed approach is acceptable, could you confirm that so that I have a clear count of votes on the proposal? We will address the issue of participation as we dive further into the details, but it is a valid concern (and perhaps an opportunity as well).

  - **Response:** [Stuart] Joe, your concern about the people required for this structure is a shared concern--particularly at the level of the committees. In the end, there is the systemic question of whether DCMI should be engaged in any activity for which there is insufficient volunteer community support for the activity to thrive. In other words, if there is insufficient volunteer community interest in one of the committees, then it follows that there is insufficient interest to maintain the activity. In such a case, the organizational structure and what DCMI does should be pruned accordingly. ¶The committees as set out in the proposed structure reflect areas where DCMI is already engaged at one level or another. IMHO as a DCMI citizen, any activity beyond the core of maintenance and further development of the DCMI "crown jewels" (i.e., its core specifications) and perhaps the annual meeting and conference will have to pass muster in terms of sufficient volunteer community interest to maintain the activity. DCMI lacks the resources (fiscal and human) to drive activities in any other way..
