Dear Program Committee Members:

Peer review assignments for DC-20@@ will be assigned over the next several days.  Reviewer guidelines are available at:  

http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/reviewerGuidelines

Reviewers will be assigned from 1 to 4 submissions to review.  You will receive a separate email message from the peer review system for each submission you have been assigned.  Those email messages will include:

(1) information about the individual submission;
(2) the review deadline;  
(3) a direct link to the submission in the peer review system; and
(4) a request that you follow the link provided to the submission as soon as possible and complete Step #1 by accepting or declining the assignment.  You may return later to actually complete the review.

Once assignments have been made, you will also be able to access a listing of all of your assignments by logging into the conference system at:

If you have substantive questions about the process, please contact one of the Program Committee co-chairs:
