</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Each EU government handles and publishes vast amounts of information and documents which need some form of permanent identification if citizens and businesses and the governments themselves are to locate information resources with confidence and over time. The most common identifier used for electronic information published via the internet is the URL but this has drawbacks, such as it is not persistent and does not carry any associated metadata with it.</P>
<P>There are a number of alternatives to URLS but there are various issues, such as costs and functionality. In order to ensure consistency, reliability and interoperability in accessing information resources across the EU, governments need guidance about the on use and implementation of persistent identifiers for information and documents.

</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Each EU government should be using taxonomies across their information and services resources to enable administrators to manage content and services and citizens to locate information and services. Governments and their citizens also need to exchange information across administrative boundaries, as well as having system interoperability; semantic interoperability is an essential component that will allow this to happen.</P>
<P>In order to achieve semantic interoperability, Governments need to either map their taxonomies to other government taxonomies or use a common taxonomy. Each option has limitations: all using the same taxonomy is not practical yet and mapping is in practise very difficult because of the conceptual difference between different taxonomies. </P>
<P>Nevertheless, interoperability is needed at a European scale. This work item will identify which official government taxonomies are in use, what their core features are, identify elements which allow for semantic interoperability and look at the feasibility of an administrative thesaurus as a possible solution to initial semantic interoperability.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Places Services Metadata Proposal</P>

<P>The community developing metadata for use in the process of making Web content available to all have set a new standard. They have a user profile which describe the needs and preferences, especially of those with disabilities, so that computers and systems can be dynamically adapted to suit those needs. Web content will need to be described in appropriate ways so that it is possible to determine the qualities of content, and whether it will match a given profile. Users experience with such systems will include the adaptation of the interfaces and access devices of computers as well as the choice of content of what is provided to them by those devices.</P>
<P>Now it is necessary to think about the results of searches which find cinemas, other public buildings, employment and entertainment facilities, recreation activities and many other services and locations. When people with special needs reach sets of pointers to services or locations, they need to be able to determine if those services or locations will, in fat, be useful to them. Accessibility is a major component of this. </P>
<P>A person who searches for a film and has a need for wheel-chair access, is not very interested in being told how many places are showing the film but have no access for them. A person who has to make considerable effort to get to an automatic teller machine does not want to find that it is too high for them to use. A blind person does not want to be directed to a graphical kiosk and a deaf person does not want to be told to listen to the recorded instructions for using a museum display. In many cases, the providers have taken time to make their services or locations accessible but it is just too hard to find out that this is the case, so people avoid the services or locations for fear of finding them inaccessible.</P>
<P>There are many signs, electronic data-bases, and other information systems that record accessibility of services and locations but they are not linked in to the other services that people use in making their choice of which service or location to use. There are taxonomies of physical access, and also of services, but these are not organised in a way that makes it easy for those who use Dublin Core metadata and systems that deploy DC metadata to its full potential, to choose and use these taxonomies.</P>
<P>It seems very overdue for DC metadata to think about the extended aspects of locations and services and make accessibility information a priority. This is necessary at the early stages of extending DC metadata specifications to include locations and services because otherwise it becomes too difficult to add it in. It is also the case that almost every bit of accessibility information turns out to benefit not just the community for whom it is often seen to be essential. People with disabilities have the same needs as people with babies, people with bikes, people who are a little older, people who have broken their legs ski-ing, and the thousands who wear protective clothing, work in noisy places, or do other things that make them temporarily unable to use all their faculties and senses. </P>

</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Mobile telecommunications is an area where Europe has and wishes to maintain a world leading position. At the same time, electronic Government (e-Government) is considered a top priority in the European political agenda, while the exploitation of public sector information is considered essential for economic growth. </P>

<P>The aim of this project is to propose a framework on the practical use of metadata in the domain of mobile Government (m-Government). The framework should be based on the activities of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative and relevant international and European activities and standards in the area of e-Government. </P>

<P>More specifically, this project will commence by reviewing mobile applications for government, metadata frameworks in the domain of e-Government, and practical consideration on the use of metadata in mobile devices. This project will proceed by proposing a suitable Metadata Application Profile for m-Government. The project will also propose a suitable Metadata Framework along with deployment guidelines for Member States. </P>

<P>The deliverable of this project will be three CWAs. The CWAs as well as the EU/EFTA support for each one of them follows: </P>

<P>CWA on a DC-based m-Government Metadata Application Profile – 40 person days </P>
<P>CWA on a m-Government Metadata Framework – 30 person days </P>
<P>CWA on Deployment Guidelines of the m-Government Metadata Framework – 30 person days</P>

<P>Total: 100 person days. </P>

<P>It is expected that there will be at least an equal amount of voluntary effort i.e. another 100 person days. Therefore, the total cost of the project will be 200 person days i.e. 100 person days EU/EFTA support and 100 person days voluntary contribution. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Objectives - links with other/previous work:</P>
<P>The first year of the online service "AskDCMI" has yielded a rich set of questions actually posed by users with regard to methods and techniques around Dublin Core. This work item will analyze this and other sources to develop a fuller catalog of user needs and use this analysis in developing a richer FAQ about Dublin Core practice. The FAQ will be designed with long-term maintainability in mind by dividing the issues into clearly delineated and defined modules, the maintenance of which will be distributable among multiple maintainers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This work item will involve the following:</P>
<P>-- Analysis of AskDCMI data and collection of further data for identifying salient questions asked by implementors</P>
<P>of Dublin Core metadata.</P>
<P>-- Creation of a FAQ structured for long-term maintainability.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Expertise required:</P>
<P>In-depth knowledge of Dublin Core both on theoretical and practical levels, familiarity with DCMI processes, demonstrable experience in writing Dublin Core-related guidance.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Objectives - links with other/previous work:</P>
<P>CWA 14855 of November 2003 specifies a documentary format for Dublin Core Application Profiles (DCAPs), which describe the terms used in the metadata for an application or user community. A further CWA under development in 2004 builds on CWA 14855 by providing an abstract model and RDF binding for expressing a DCAP for processing by machines. Taken together, these two CWAs point on a work-flow leading from the analysis of the metadata</P>
<P>requirements of a given application from the standpoint of interoperability to a more rigorous formal statement of how that metadata uses standard vocabularies.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This work item will involve the following:</P>
<P>-- Revision of the CWAs on Documentational DCAPs and Machine-processable DCAPs for consistency with each other</P>
<P>and for conformance with the DCMI Abstract Model, which by 2005 is expected to have advanced to the status of</P>
<P>DCMI Recommendation.</P>
<P>-- Drafting of a third CWA explaining how the abovementioned CWAs fit into a broader work-flow leading from interoperability analysis to data translation and normalization.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Expertise required:</P>
<P>Demonstrable experience with theoretical and practical aspects of Application Profiles for Dublin Core implementations, knowledge of XML Schemas, RDF Schemas, demonstrable experience in writing</P>
<P>Dublin Core-related guidance.</P>
