<P>Report by Liddy Neville, project team member Work Item 5</P>
</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>This was a combined workshop led by MMI-DC and SWAD-E. It was hosted by the Danish National Library Authority and SWAD-E. It brought together developers and users working on the multilingual application of metadata and metadata in a multilingual world. It was focused on the semantic web with the aim for the MMI-DC to discover and discuss problems of multilingualism with advanced developers of Semantic Web technologies. The aim was to discover what could and should be done to increase accessibility of resources to all people.</P>

<P>The meeting was chaired by Charles McCathieNevile whose report appears at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dev_workshop_report_7">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dev_workshop_report_7</A> .</P>

<B><P>Related work </P>
</B><P>A position paper was provided by Thomas Baker who was unable to attend the meeting. </P>
<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Activity maintains a number of international mirrors of its content, with a variable amount available in translation, including schemas, documents describing usage, etc. DCMI has a problem concerned with making metadata in multiple languages so all can use DC metadata and gain appropriate access to content.</P>
<P>The W3C maintains a collection of documents, and a glossary derived from those documents. A large number of volunteer translators provide translations of various for these documents, and in some cases terms from the glossary, in order to help ensure consistency of translations. The Semantic Web is being used for this activity.</P>
<P>A number of countries or organisations are working in multiple languages - Fundaci&oacute;n Sidar is one, working primarily in Castellano, Catal&aacute;, Gallego and Portugu&ecirc;s with collections of documents and tools. Some of Sidar's tools, such as Hera, are using multilingual RDF vocabularies as a base for interfaces and document output. </P>

</B><P>The workshop was attended by developers from </P>

<UL>
<LI>Australia </LI>

<P>It was broadcast via an <I>IRC</I>, allowing remote participation, and at relevant points various developers took part in the workshop through this method. </P>
<P>It was mostly conducted in English but at times other languages took over as English was a minority first language.</P>

<B><P>Technical discussion </P>
</B><P>A number of <I>tools</I> and <I>vocabularies</I> were presented or discussed. It was clear that in some areas there is a lot of development, and tools are moving towards the standards of products developed commercially for end users, while other areas still involved research and development. </P>
<P>In particular, tools dealing with time or location in any complexity tend to be in the early phases of development. </P>

<B><P>Use cases </P>
</B><P>A substantial amount of discussion was devoted to looking at use cases - the things that participants actually want the semantic web to do. </P>

<P>Multilingual glossaries</P>
<P>This topic was covered in several different cases. Simply <I>providing a multilingual glossary for W3C</I>, providing systems for <I>relating concepts to different symbolic representations</I>, tools for <I>finding meanings by comparing contexts</I> and similar topics were discussed throughout the workshop. </P>

<P>Extending glossaries </P>
<P>Various more powerful systems that could incorporate cultural contexts to glossaries are important. From the simple case of <I>reading menus</I>, to ways of searching for <I>similar information across multilingual knowledge</I> bases. </P>

<P>Names and addresses </P>
<P>Internationally, ways of naming people vary widely. This is in addition to the various different forms of address that might be used in different contexts. Therefore, systems for <I>matching people's names, and providing intuitive searching</I> (where one person will not have a consistent part of the name as the most obvious metonymic trigger for the different people that they know) need to provide powerful, context-dependent methods for encoding names. Similarly, although perhaps less complex, people's addresses contain different information according to where they live. </P>

<P>Matching to users' locations </P>
<P>Localising software is a common use case. Additionally, being able to <I>localize the way a web page is served</I>, according to what the user expects, may be desirable in many instances. Providing <I>multilingual systems to create metadata</I> is also helpful. For example, many people may be describing an image using different natural languages. </P>

<B><P>Work still needed </P>
</B><P>A clear outcome of the workshop was the need for simple step-by-step explanations of how to use vocabularies, oriented to developers who want to copy working examples rather than understand the entire theoretical base and then deriving their own tools and code.</P>
