</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report covers the issues with respect to access for all at all times identified in the MMI-DC Workshops. It is apparent that there is substantial benefit from thinking of multilingualism, and all it encompasses, at the same time as considering other accessibility issues. This is, therefore, a combined report aimed to provide guidance on what has been done and remains to be done in order to ensure maximum accessibility to information for all at all times. What follows is a summary of the problems associated with multilingualism and mismatching of content to users, which is described here as a lack of accessibility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 2.1 Multilinguality</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Union’s official languages have recently increased from eleven to twenty. The linguistic combinations will increase from one hundred and ten to two hundred and ten. CEN Europe is probably the most diverse conglomerate on this planet and its wealth of cultures, traditions, languages and customs is the reason for this diversity. Given Europe’s inclusion of people from the north of Iceland all the way down to the southern parts of Spain and Malta, and its use of many, long established written languages, using four main alphabets - Latin, Greek, Cyrillic and Hebrew, as well as the range of Asian languages in use, many Europeans have difficulties when using the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As more and more homes and offices take up Broadband access, and service providers exploit the new facilities, so more are denied or disenfranchised from public services and private activities. Accessibility has had a variety of definitions tagged to it but this report will set out to see accessibility mean <B>accessibility to all at all times</B>. The Italian who does not speak Greek may have access while at home but not when they are in Greece. The person using a wheelchair may have no difficulty at home in finding the information for, say, an ATM machine but may find that when they use that information they cannot access the ATM machine because of the physical steps they have to negotiate in order to reach it. Accessibility is about treating everyone as equal, regardless of culture, language or any disabilities they may have. Lack of accessibility is defined as a mismatch between a person’s access means and those available to them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc73523018">2. 2 Accessibility </A></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accessibility is defined as the matching of people’s information and service needs with their needs and preferences in terms of intellectual and sensory engagement with that information or service, and control of it. For instance, a person with a motor-co-ordination disability is not well matched to information when they are required to use a mouse click within a too tightly limited time to gain access to that information or service. A person who is engaged in an eyes-busy activity such as driving a vehicle is not well matched to information when they are required to read small text on a screen. A person who does not speak French is not well matched to information when they can only access French instructions for operating a course enrolment system. A person who is dyslexic and another who is not a native speaker of a given language may find they can understand content better if it is supported by images, and does not use inappropriate, culturally-specific allusions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accessibility is satisfied when there is a match regardless of culture, language or disabilities. Accessibility to all, at all times, is used to mean accessibility to digital resources and services in all contexts in which technical access is available. It is not concerned with the significant but out of scope issue of access to communications technology that makes possible the access of interest here. Issues of economic disadvantage, or specificity of disability, are not of concern. Particular care has been taken to ensure that all people’s needs are considered equally so no distinction is drawn between a person using an assistive technology because they must and another person using the latest jazzy mobile device. Accessibility is worked on as a kind of device, location, context, ability independent requirement for all content and services. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The international community, led by the World Wide Web Consortium, has participated in work to develop technologies and ways of using them to ensure that it is possible to construct digital content in ways that can be accessible to all. Sometimes this involves merely using the standard technologies in the recommended way, and at other times it means creating necessary additional content or services so that those who need them can use them. The problems of interest to this Special Workshop are those to do with the role of metadata in making content and services accessible to all at all times.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the user, matching their needs is of primary importance and in some cases critical to their ability to function. Some people’s needs include automatically adjusted technology interfaces, as they do not have the capability to make the adjustments themselves. For others, this is also essential because they cannot spare the time or do not have the expertise to achieve this. Such needs are often associated with the use of special hardware or software that is necessary for the person to use a device, such as a computer or phone, to seek and use resources and services of interest to them. Users with such needs require information about whether resources and services can be accessed with their combination of agents so that they do not find they have configured their device for no benefit. Such a situation would arise where a person is only able to use keystrokes to move a cursor about in content and access keys are not enabled by the resource or services. So it is display characteristics and control features that are of interest to the user.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to content, access is dependent upon a number of factors. A user needs to be able to use the range of sensory modalities upon which access to the content depends. Where a person does not have the necessary sensory capability at the time, alternative content in another modality may be required. In some cases, the modality of content can be altered and this is particularly true of text. In addition, the content itself may be in a form that is not interpretable to the user. If it is in a foreign language, dependent upon an unsuitable reading level, not accompanied by sufficient imagery&gt; Where cultural specificity is not suitable, or where metaphors are limited in understanding, it will still be inaccessible to the user. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For users to discover and access the resources and services they need, their needs and the resource accommodations must be described in a standard way. Dublin Core metadata provides the perfect architecture for this and the information model developed by a wide community co-ordinated by IMS Global Learning Consortium provides the necessary well-structured semantics. The user and resource profiles, having been developed with broad input, are suitable for adoption and use by many metadata communities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is needed in Europe is DCMI’s recommendation of a standard extension to Dublin Core architecture that will simplify the creation and exchange of user profiles and DCMI’s recommendation of an application profile that accommodates the metadata necessary for resources and services. Interestingly, while accessibility is of general concern to all providers of resources and content, the metadata necessary for its provision is likely to be created by specialists in accessibility, using tools from the growing range. For this reason, it is expected that the best way to facilitate creation of the necessary metadata is to use a separate application profile but to include the content of this within a new DC accessibility element. For the user profile, it may be necessary to do more work to develop a person profile into which the accessibility metadata could be integrated. This approach is likely to serve both the needs of users from the accessibility perspective, and other needs likely to be identified as being for e-government, e-business and other domains. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI><A NAME="_Toc80159698"><A NAME="_Toc80350249"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5>Multilingualism</A></A></LI></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Multilingualism has, of course, been defined many times and what matters is its meaning in a given context. In this context, multilingualism is considered from the perspective of the range of speakers and readers. Being able to communicate or engage with communicated material is at the core of multilingualism. Being alienated or disenfranchised because of a lack of language for communication is as alarming as being physically prevented from access to a location. Again, matching people to communications in languages with which they have facility is access to communications, whether live or asynchronous, face-to-face or remote. Lack of access is lack of a match.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Languages have inherent qualities: many of these are linguistic but others are cultural. Obviously, metaphors based on regionally or culturally specific analogies do not necessarily translate into other languages. What is often not realised is that there are other qualities that affect language use: there are different ways of describing time, location, people’s identities, and more. Conversations across language boundaries are endlessly surprising; the provision of multiple-language versions of content and translation of content are almost always problematic. But within languages there are also problems: levels of facility with complexity of languages and limitations of languages are two examples. Not everyone is capable of understanding the same form of representation in any given language, yet we know this is not just a matter of literacy learning; for some it is to do with how well they have learned to read and for others it is to do with constraints imposed on them by such disabilities as dyslexia and disnumeracy. Those dependent upon Braille, for example, can find that their language does not yet have ways of representing information which is easily represented in other languages.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dublin Core metadata architecture was developed with an awareness of internationalisation issues. Dr Thomas Baker, in the early days of Dublin Core development, drew attention to the need for translations not only in European but also in Asian and other languages. His efforts led to the constant awareness of this issue and from the early days there were translations of the Dublin Core documents. The DC elements were not expected to be translated as this would destroy interoperability; the values for those elements could, however, be in any language. This approach, while commendable, is not completely satisfactory as an internationalisation strategy and other problems have also been under consideration. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How, for instance, does DCMI ensure that the translation is a true translation. One strategy is to assign responsibility for this to an authoritative entity that will be in a better position to determine the accuracy of the translation. A typical example is provided by the role of the New Zealand National Library in the translation into Maori. Of course, this is inspired also by the knowledge that it is unlikely that anyone but New Zealanders will be experts in Maori. But what about French? Or Spanish? A huge community of Web users speak Spanish beyond those who live in Spain and other parts of Europe. Communication between all people of the Spanish speaking world is of critical significance to Spanish content developers and so the use of Dublin Core elements needs to be uniform throughout the whole Spanish speaking world. As with English being used in European, American, African and Asian regions, people can be separated ‘by a common language’. Many European languages are used in more than their country of origin, and versions and dialects are as diverse and difficult to reconcile as a potential translator’s understanding of the Dublin Core standard itself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Translations are designed to carry meaning and it is critical to the translation of the semantics of DC metadata that these are well understood and accurate. Japanese presents a problem when one considers the use of the identity and title tags. The role of words is not the same in all languages. It is understood that in Japanese, words can represent identity in ways that they do not in English. The translation of the DC element set for Japanese users has, therefore, required special explanation about how to use the terms. Whether this is true of other languages is not known, but unless it is known and dealt with, there can be no confidence in translations.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an inherent danger in a report like this, encompassing such a large topic, to take a long time to produce results. This work has focused on being short in duration and identifying projects that can be started immediately with short time spans to completion.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work also considered whether to take a &quot;top down approach&quot; or a &quot;bottom up approach&quot;. The need for something different was voiced by many experts in this field. A &quot;peer to peer&quot; approach was selected to ensure future possible projects would link together, allowing for others to build on this work. There is a need to further this report to a second stage to investigate other connecting activities that will enable access to all at all times.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that while this project was written under a European remit, many other countries outside Europe have participated in this work, including the USA, Canada and Australia. This report tries not to show any European boundaries in order to ensure compatibility on a global scale and therefore a lack of redundancy and conflict.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The approach to the problem of maintaining the semantics and syntax that is currently being endorsed and implemented by this group involves the use of registries. Registries are machine-readable <B>databases of terms that can be used by different applications to support inter-operability of disparate data sets. They depend upon registration of data-set structures by those using them and need to provide access to this information (or data) to others who need it to inter-operate.  Registries are making clear the complexity of the problem and are seen as an immediate step in the process but there is a hope that in the long term, automated systems will replace them, so the dependence upon maintenance will be less burdensome.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.4 Workshop on Metadata for a Multilingual World </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was a workshop held in Copenhagen in July 2004 by the CEN MMI-DC and the Semantic Web Advanced Development in Europe projects. The attendees were focused on the use of Semantic Web technology to support multilingualism. This was immediately agreed to include multiculturalism and languages other than natural spoken languages, including those such as symbolic scientific languages, Braille, and concept and sign languages.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The participants were experts in internationalisation and multilingual problems and included the Chair of the W3C Internationalisation Working Group. Identification of difficulties by the participants individually and collectively, and possible solutions or work items were the main topic of the workshop.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thomas Baker proposed a framework for thinking about machine-readable translations of semantics so there would be a clear separation between a concept, to be fixed and unchanged, and the representation or explanation of it in a multiplicity of forms and languages. Joseph Reagle wrote about the problems of having machine-readable descriptions that were not compatible. Bengt Farre writes about the value and limitations of working with concepts as a base for automated translation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Baker concluded:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the purposes of interoperability, it is desirable that the number of URIs used in the metadata of the world be kept down lest we overload the Semantic Web with assertions of the sort that "term http://foo.org/1.1/bar is compatible with http://foo.org/1.2/bar ".  At the same time, other purposes require precision with regard to historical version.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be helpful for all concerned if a broader consensus could be reached on some of the general issues outlined above, such as the contrast between a Term Concept and a Term Version (however we might want to call them) and on the allowability of "semantically compatible" evolution within a Term Concept.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Task Force on Vocabulary Management in the W3C Semantic Web Best Practice and Deployment Working Group hopes to make some progress in this direction [</FONT><A HREF="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004Jun/0136.html"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004Jun/0136.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>].</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problems were identified relating to time, space, location, people, mixing and matching of information, etc. Cultures, languages and machines do not share either a common vocabulary or a sense of what these things are. There is no direct compatibility and yet it is crucial to interoperability.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a preliminary report from the Copenhagen workshop, it was concluded that:</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear that in some areas there is a lot of development, and tools are moving towards the standards of products developed commercially for end users, while other areas still involved research and development. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, tools dealing with time or location in any complexity tend to be in the early phases of development. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work still needed:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A clear outcome of the workshop was the need for simple step-by-step explanations of how to use vocabularies oriented to developers who want to copy working examples rather than understand the entire theoretical base and then derive their own tools and code. &quot; culturally and linguistically different.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="_Toc73523022"><A NAME="_Toc80159701"><A NAME="_Toc80350252"></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=5>6. Special Workshop</A> - Accessibility</A></A></LI></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Special Workshop on accessibility was held in April 2004 with thirty international experts from the field of accessibility attending. The focus of the Workshop was to arrive at scenarios of current situations in this field in order to develop a plan for further work. Participants spent time thinking about what accessibility metadata needs they could identify in their experience and what solutions they were aware of that might help solve their, or others’ problems. The process involved some presentations and the development of scenarios that represented problems. An open-ended list of issues was created.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear from the meeting that there has been a lot of work done to develop technologies and techniques for making accessible resources and services. Participants were challenged to think about the role of metadata in the situation where, as is the case currently, most resources and services are not accessible but nevertheless people are required to function so have to try to use them. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Workshop participants worked through an agenda that had them refining problems and issues. The documents at Annex C represent the range of documents produced in the process. The content of the many documents has been analyzed and summarized in the main report. The first documents collected were pre-seminar statements from participants explaining their interest in a seminar on accessibility metadata. These were followed by small group definitions of people who might need to be considered. Following this, participants developed comprehensive scenarios and considered the issues they raised. Finally they considered possible solutions, available and being developed and outstanding issues.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A specific problem for people when thinking about accessibility is to separate the role of those who develop the technologies and techniques from that of the metadata. Another was associated with the advances being made in the field of metadata, particularly the use of metadata in what is known as the ‘Semantic Web’. Machine readable and usable information is the distinguishing feature of Semantic Web work that increases the need for standardization of ways of describing people’s needs and resources and services. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it is often hard to distinguish between needs with respect to digital resources and services and physical objects and contexts. Conventionally, metadata is used to describe digital objects and the familiar model of description for physical resources, such as books, is carried across to the field of description of digital objects. Many digital objects, however, are closely linked to physical ones. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A movie review, for instance, is usually read after having been found as part of a result set when a person is looking for a movie to view. The next question, or perhaps the first, for the person is usually when is the film on and where. In cases where the person has a disability, the answers for this query that are likely to be of interest are only those that point to viewing the movie in a location that is physically accessible. Quickly it becomes obvious that accessibility of physical locations is of major concern to people with disabilities, and so metadata describing them should be made available.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of scenarios were developed during the Workshop. One of the outstanding themes was the repetition of discussion about the need for a framework for accessibility and CLA to show what needs to be achieved in order to adopt a sensible policy on this issue. A number of organisations are working on aspects of the problem but there is not a unifying agency that is supervising the transition/distinction of work on metadata from work on technologies and techniques. While cooperation is a feature of the work done by those concerned about accessibility, coordination is a problem. Funding for such an activity is not forthcoming because what funding there is, is consistently directed towards solving a particular problem, depending on the goodwill and generosity of others to help coordinate the work.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 4</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A framework for accessibility and CLA This framework requires a set of guidelines for metadata to help the implementer maintain interoperability, meeting the needs of accessibility for all at all times, while considering locally specific and relevant aspects. The W3C Semantic Web programme would form part of this framework.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 6</B> </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Location-specific access metadata elements to describe physical locations and access to them. This could include contexts that necessitate special user profiles. Examples include where a context has special characteristics such as that there is a high level of noise and sound features of resources and services will not be audible, or there is a safety need for gloves so that fine motor-coordination will not be available for use of keys and a mouse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A person, who wishes to see a film in a cinema and needs wheelchair access in order to do so, is not very interested in being told how many places are showing the film but have no access for them.  They need to know if there is wheelchair access and if there is a space available to them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A person who has to make considerable effort to get to an automatic teller machine does not want to find that it is physically beyond their reach.  They need to know if the machine is accessible to them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A blind person does not want to be directed to a graphical kiosk and a deaf person does not want to be told to listen to the recorded descriptions for interpreting a museum display. They need to know what is available to them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many cases, the providers have taken time to make their services or locations accessible but it is just too hard to find out that this is the case, so people avoid the services or locations for fear of finding them inaccessible.  Making location specific metadata will allow providers to offer a more refined search.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 7</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A way to record and store information that describes the access needs of users. A student with disabilities and so special needs using computers on a university campus needs the computer being used to automatically be configured for their use and to revert to a default state for subsequent users. Providers of computing facilities and content needs a convenient way to discover what is required for them to be able to satisfy a user’s needs. Information about a user’s needs should be in a standard form to ensure its inter-operability.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 8</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A tool that allows a student considering embarking on a course to determine the accessibility of the course content and to assess what will be required to make the course fully accessible to them. The course providers need information that will allow them to make accurate assessments of the work required and the cost of such work and the chance of success of any work to be undertaken. Such information should be in a standard form so that it is interoperable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the process of identifying possible solutions to problems, several presentations were made to show what is possible and what is already being developed. Industry Canada initiated work that has now been adopted and supported by many and should emerge as a standard in the field of accessibility. The following scenarios illustrate some of the possibilities. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 9</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A member of the public goes to their local library to find some specific information and is directed to the government information service available there on the computers.  An assistant sits with them to help them find what they need.  As this is the first visit, the assistant runs through a series of tests to determine what will be suitable in terms of control, display and content, for this person. The assistant adjusts the display so the person can see what is on the screen, and when all is well, records the person’s access profile. Once this is done, the assistant is able to show the person how to use a search engine that takes account of the profile, including in the enquiry terms relating to language density and transformability, to focus the search for information that is particularly geared towards that person’s needs. Suitable content is found and, having been reviewed on the screen, is made available to the person in large print for them to take away. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hard to see how accessibility needs can be met without this user profile approach. No two people are the same according to some neat, generic class, and no person is the same in all contexts. Having a multiplicity of profiles related to contexts makes it possible for a person with disabilities to use one that is appropriate at the time, including one that takes into account that as it is late in the day, they will probably be extra tired and able to exert less effort.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All scenarios describing user needs point to the need for standardised metadata as the means of recording user profiles and metadata on the resources and services that allow for the recording of data on language density and transformability. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect of metadata use that emerged as significant was the way in which Semantic Web technologies are helping solve problems. Third parties are often required to increase the accessibility of resources and this can be achieved by having a system that associates annotations with the original content and then uses those annotations to transform the original content. This has been done with content for dyslexic people but needs to be made available for the range of needs and preferences. It depends, in the end, on Semantic Web technologies to help transform the artistic or ‘semantic’ part of the content. For example, an item containing a rich text section describing a bed of tulips by using a metaphor associated with a well-known landmark in Warsaw may need to be replaced by an image of the range of reds available in flames to demonstrate equivalent meaning. The connection between the flames and Warsaw may not be direct, but determinable by reference to the Semantic Web.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Special Workshop held an on-line meeting before, during and after the Workshop had finished, thus allowing the continual refinement of ideas. Many issues were left unresolved due to the tight timeframe but these are explained later. Another Workshop was suggested to look at CLA issues specifically. The first workshop was well attended with attendees covering their own costs. The full list can be found in Annex D.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those attending the Special Workshop, together with those who were unable to do so but who showed an active interest in it, formed a Review Group for this report. Before this report was published, the Review Group read and refined the content. The Review Group was established on a mailing list and was provided with a forum and a register for posting messages and documents. This Review Group and the website will stay in existence to continue the interaction on this subject.</P>

Providers of computing facilities and content needs a convenient way to discover what is required for them to be able to satisfy a user’s needs. Information about a user’s needs should be in a standard form to ensure its inter-operability.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 8</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A tool that allows a student considering embarking on a course to determine the accessibility of the course content and to assess what will be required to make the course fully accessible to them. The course providers need information that will allow them to make accurate assessments of the work required and the cost of such work and the chance of success of any work to be undertaken. Such information should be in a standard form so that it is interoperable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEED 9 </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hard to see how accessibility needs can be met without a user profile approach. No two people are the same according to some neat, generic class, and no person is the same in all contexts. Having a multiplicity of profiles related to contexts makes it possible for a person with disabilities to use one that is appropriate at the time, including one that takes into account that as it is late in the day, they will probably be extra tired and able to exert less effort.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All scenarios describing user needs point to the need for standardised metadata as the means of recording user profiles and metadata on the resources and services that includes the recording of data on language density and transformability. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After considering the available information, the following CEN ISSS MMI-DC development activities are recommended if CEN is to be assured that accessibility metadata is interoperable and available to ensure maximum accessibility of resources and services for all at all times:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Development of an application profile for the description of the accessibility of physical locations, and events</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Development of an application profile for the description of contexts in which people may need to be accessing resources and services</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Development of an application profile for accessibility standards compliance</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Creation of a new element for Dublin Core metadata, DC-accessibility, in which accessibility of resources and services can be described</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Development of an application profile for minority language support; development of an application profile for text containing symbolic languages</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Development of an application profile for people that includes their access needs and preferences </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Creation of a report and a workshop on further activities, given the potential of the Semantic Web developments to provide solutions to many accessibility problems, and the insoluble link with Dublin Core Metadata to make it possible</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be noted that while there is a need for the multiplicity of profiles, in any given situation, for any given user, resource or service, the minimum amount of metadata should be recorded and in some cases this will be very little indeed.</P><DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii's short paper for April 30 </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this short paper ASCii will amplify on its interest in participating at  the CEN/ISSS Workshop on MMI-DC on April 30. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii has established itself as a specialist in Internet communications, both  in content (creation and management of sites) and in form (portals, web  interface, databases ...). We are a private company, based in Brussels, which  recently joined the SWORD-group. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii's biggest client is the European Commission's Directorate General Press  and Communication. On their behalf we develop and update many key pages on the EUROPA server . If requested, we build web  applications for e-government as well. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii set up an accessibility department in the spring of 2003. Besides  creating new accessible websites, we also audit existing sites to validate their  level of accessibility. If they aren't, we propose the client to make them WCAG  compliant. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii's accessibility department </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The team consists of four persons at the moment: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Project manager is Marc Walraven, who has been working in the field of web   accessibility for several years, as well as on governmental as on company   level. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our programmer develops on a fulltime basis a Java-based multi-platform   tool for internal use. This software facilitates accessibility validation,   reporting and repairing. It takes a lot of work out our hands so that we can   spend our time on less repetitive and thus more interesting tasks. At this   moment the tool generates reports in Microsoft Word format and in EARL. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A webmaster, specialised in accessibility, is in charge of the technical   coordination of all projects (validation with a bunch of tools and manual   testing, auditing, correcting pages, research ...) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, a blind web accessibility specialist assists on several levels   (quality control, auditing, research ...) </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to keep our knowledge in accessibility matters up to date and to  share our</FONT><FONT FACE="ComicSansMS,Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>experience with others, ASCii participates in international seminars  and is a partner of organisations working in the field of web accessibility like  the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Working Group and the EuroAccessibility Consortium .</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ASCii also works in close collaboration with the European Commission's "Comit&eacute; Editorial Inter-Institutionnel Internet ", and is co-author  of the Information  Providers Guide which establishes the editorial, technical and graphical guidelines for publishing web pages on the EUROPA server. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Metadata for accessibility </P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want our sites not only to be technically accessible but also as usable as possible to the widest range of people. The European audience is extremely diverse with regard to all kinds of computers, operating systems, browsers, assistive technologies, to the wide range of languages spoken and to people's different abilities and knowledge to operate their equipment, ranging from novices to expert in the ICT world. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to coordinate the enormous amount of documents, the Commission will introduce an XML-based web content management system (wcms) later this year. With this wcms it will be possible to personalise the requested information for different kinds of people and/or computer configurations. Probably the only way to succeed in this challenge will be to develop a high-performance set of metadata. If we succeed this will dramatically improve the accessibility of the EUROPA pages. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, our particular interest lies in automating as much as possible the insertion of metadata for accessibility into a web site or web application. We hope the discussion won't be limited to static web pages. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next we think metadata can play an important role in a multilingual world. As we work most of the time for European institutions we deal every day with documents in the twenty languages of the enlarged European Union. But again we should agree on a method to let a content management system automatically deal with this task. The on line document collections are too big to update them manually. Furthermore, the metadata contents should be easily translatable in order to put not too many extra pressure on the already difficult and expensive translation task. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After having read carefully the Metadata specifications ACCLIP from Imsglobal/Dublin Core and the TechDIS metadata, we plead to make the accessibility metadata system not more detailed and technical than necessary. Web accessibility is already a complicated issue for a majority of people. We hope there will be no need to add an extra day to our accessibility training course only dealing</FONT><FONT FACE="ComicSansMS,Comic Sans MS"> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>with instructions on metadata. A company can't afford to double an accessible website's development time because it has to insert metadata.</FONT><FONT FACE="ComicSansMS,Comic Sans MS"> </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We don't want accessibility to be a subject that is just understood by a few highly skilled technicians. If the goal is to achieve an accessible Internet, the rules/guidelines of implementing metadata should be clear, indisputable, consistent and uniform. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are looking forward to an interesting and collaborative workshop. We hope to contribute to the concrete outcome of the work from our experience in daily work. </P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Introduction</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core issue of accessibility in the publishing world is the actual interpretation that people would give to the term itself. This could be seen as an academic issue, but actually it’s not. According to Claudio Imprudente1, founder of the Progetto Calamaio at the Centro Documentazione dell'Handicap - Bologna, it is worth introducing a clear distinction between deficit and handicap [1]. The first is a real, objective lack of something: blindness is a deficit.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second is the situation that reveals the deficit: a non-Braille written text given to a blind turns to be a handicap, but also a Braille text given to a blind that does not know this encoding method is an handicap. Therefore handicap is everything that prevents a human being from fully exploiting life.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time handicap can be augmented, diminished or removed while deficit will remain unchanged. Moreover education to handicap acceptance is a way to reduce handicap itself [1].</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cultural or linguistic differences, cost factors, consolidated habits, lack of knowledge, skill or user acceptance are real handicaps and contribute to raise cultural barriers and prevent access to culture and education at every level from children up to elderly people.</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the progressive adoption of digitisation and computers in managing archives, several different standardshave been developed, as far as metadata are concerned, and several cross mapping operations have been attempted, as it was necessary to make different systems interoperate (just take into account Dublin Core [3] and how it maps onto other standards [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, constant evolution, in market and content fruition media, pushes towards a never-ending process of requirement modification. This implies that there should be a certain degree of adaptability to market changes even while retaining a high degree of stability to grant backwards and cross compatibility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our vision one of the real issue is that mapping is just an aspect of the metadata management, there are other and critical ones like content accessibility and multi-lingual management. Simply taking into account the multi-lingual issue adds more than an order of magnitude to the complexity and, at present, there is no trivial solution. Actually most systems exploit data redundancy to solve the issue, which means that, generally, metadata that have to be multi-lingual are replicated and there is one instance for each managed language. This is an obvious disadvantage as brings to potential misalignments and could be a very error-prone process.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The accessibility issue is often perceived as something simply related to impaired people support in accessing data. In our opinion this is just one aspect of the whole problem. As we stated earlier the issue of accessibility covers every aspect of content.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just to give some examples we can consider keyword based archiving and retrieving. If you are looking for a document using a keyword based system rather than a full-text retrieval one you may end either without the document (despite its presence in the archive) or with too many possible results to check.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What may have actually happened is that the keywords used for the search can differ significantly from those used in the archiving process. This may depend on the human performing the archiving operation, how complete has been the content analysis process, how many significant keys may have been omitted (voluntary as considered irrelevant or erroneously simply because unidentified)...</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1 Even if affected by severe Spastic Tetra-paresis augmented by phonation problems, has been able to write several books, fairy tales and achieve many other activities devoted to promoting knowledge of handicap among young and teachers. His major objective is to promote a new point of view over handicap: a positive approach instead of the classical one centered on suffering, limitation and death.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same could apply to an image database, moreover if you are accessing a federative set of databases / archives exploiting different language plus a common one, the risk is that in the translation process a keyword may have been lost. This issue has been tackled by developing proper search infrastructure able to manage multi-lingual issues [11]. In such case a query placed into the user language will be translated into all language available inside the set of addressed repositories via a specifically designed search application (supported by dictionaries, ontology…) and then placed in parallel to all subsystems that will reply each in its own language. This is obviously a work around which does not require to duplicate all metadata and therefore avoids most of the problems mentioned before.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What just stated refers to several environments and can prove even more challenging when the e-learning environment is taken into account. We point out the multi-lingual issue as we have often encountered such problem in our daily co-edition activity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When using a foreign language, despite efforts, words will turn out to be cages for concepts. Non native speaker will be assuming for granted that words will be able to convey to the counterpart all the implication of own way of reasoning while this is only partially true. This applies even more to automatic systems where the user will assume that the system is implicitly able to manage, as it should have been designed for this, yet:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Concepts are expressed by words. If certain English words are missing in Chinese,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it follows that the concept expressed by those words will be absent in China, and</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">vice versa&quot;</I>. [2]</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that technology can properly support solving this issue if it will be possible to design applicative frameworks able to deal with issue both at insertion and retrieval time. In our opinion what proposed in [11] is a very good approach and can definitely foster a solution to the issue we propose. In fact it will be possible to embed in the application layer the access to commonly accepted thesauri, lexicon and ontology that could be used to support user in selecting the best fit for metadata input. In a very similar manner search operation could be supported too.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To achieve such result standards could make reference to a well-defined set of reference sources that could be available to application developers to implement such support layer. Just to give a better idea of what we think of, we would like to provide two examples, one in the field of library and one in the field of image collections.</P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Library &amp; Image archives examples</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most diffused methods of content classification in the filed is implemented in the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system. Now imagine that you were to classify/seek a book and you are not aware of all details of the system, you may end up making fatal errors which will either prevent you to find the resource you are looking for or others to easily find the resource you are cataloguing. In more detail according the OCLC Glossary a keyword is</FONT><FONT FACE="TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT,Times New Roman" SIZE=3> </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>&quot;a word that conveys subject content in a search for library resources. Keywords are found in titles, notes, abstracts, summaries, descriptions, and subjects. Keywords are also names of people and places that are the subjects of a library resource or a listing in a directory&quot; </I>[12].</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This gives the user an extremely wide range of action and can cause plenty of misunderstanding especially when taking into account multi-lingual databases. As a further example it is enough to point out that if a book title has been adapted during translation into a specific language to match language constraint, then a user, knowing the translation but not the original title, may end up seeking the wrong terms in the original language (due to a further translation step backwards).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In similar fashion it may end up that when seeking for a specific image into a collection. The same</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">painting may be well known with a set of different names (the &quot;Gioconda&quot; or &quot;Monna Lisa&quot; or &quot;Monnalisa&quot; from Leonardo is just an example) or there may be no actual translation for the title given by the author. Success of retrieval in such case may depend on completeness of inserted metadata, availability for proper multi-language support, richness in keywords and search infrastructure flexibility.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conclusions</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our vision accessibility has to be interpreted in the widest sense, therefore it is necessary to foresee not only adequate metadata structures but also content management frameworks and tools to be applied in order to achieve such ambitious result. We firmly believe that is only through this process that culture can be promoted, education granted and a better quality of life achieved. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3 COLOR="#0000ff"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adequate education will foster culture diffusion and multi-linguistic/cultural issue management; this in turn will foster better social coexistence and therefore a higher quality of life.We believe that a proper usage of technology will support accessibility in the wider sense, this in turn will considerably benefit from the design of suited metadata structures and related access methods.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paraphrasing Niklaus Wirth &quot;Data structures + Algorithms = Metadata Management&quot;2. A joint initiative of the various standardisation bodies, that have tacked the issue till now, to plan for some extension to the present set of metadata, in order to grant such an objective like progressing toward a really and fully accessible world of content, would be essential and desirable.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inmaculada Fajardo Bravo</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Laboratory of Human Computer Interaction for Special Needs (LIPCNE)</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">University of the Basque Country    Lardizabal<B> </B></I>1 20080 Donostia</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the particular interests of the Laboratory of Human Computer Interaction for Special Needs (LIPCNE), University of Basque Country, on the Metadata for Accessibility Workshop derives from our work with Deaf People. We are currently developing a research project called &quot;Cogniweb&quot; which is focused on empirically studying web access patterns of deaf people, with the aim of improving their cognitive accessibility.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Deafness is not only a sensorial deficiency. It also influences cognitive processing; and knowledge’s representation and organization in memory. These consequences of deafness affects to complex tasks, such as problem solving and decision making (Marschark, 2003), which are typical tasks performed by users in the web. In that sense, one of the Dublin Core’s goal supporting &quot;commonly understood semantics&quot;, which provides a <I>common set of elements universally understood and supported</I>,<I> </I>is of particular interest for the community of deaf people with great problems of vocabulary understanding and reading comprehension in general (Leybaert, Alegria, and Morais, 1982). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We think that it is extremely important to consider the theoretical background and empirical potentialities of disciplines such as Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics for developing this common set of elements. The reason is that these disciplines have a relevant data base of knowledge about the way deaf people in particular, and human beings in general, store and represent semantic information in complex systems, like the Internet. For example, deaf people do not perform a top-down process during the reading, do not use the context (that is, they read word by word) and, for this reason, working memory (a limited temporal storage of information) is overloaded. This overload could interfere text comprehension and information retrieval tasks in the Internet. Together with the limited temporal storage, the problem could be due to the organization and connection of words or concepts in the Long Term Memory, where items details are stored, more than to the relations between those items. In fact, it has been proved that, in some contexts, deaf people are worse than hearing pears in attending and recognizing relational information during the reading and in activating the categories related to the exemplars (Marschark, 2003).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, we think that we could contribute to the workshop’s discussion groups presenting some techniques developed by Cognitive Science like the Latent Semantic Analysis, LSA (Landauer, T. K., &amp; Dumais, S. T., 1997 ). LSA is a theory and a method for extracting and representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text. LSA could be useful as automatic metadata tool due to its adequacy reflection of human knowledge (and concretely, the peculiar knowledge representation of deaf people), which could solve problems like training requirements. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accessibility Metadata in the United States</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two key standards that are relevant to accessibility metadata in the United States. These are Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the W3C recommendation for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) This paper provides brief background on Section 508 and WCAG, and then discusses how compliance is accomplished by U.S. government websites. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 508</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides the legal basis requiring physical accessibility for people with disabilities to buildings and transportation. In 1998 amendments to the Act were passed that relate to information technology accessibility in federally funded programs and services. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use information technology including Federal information delivery via the Internet. Section 508 sets the standards that effectively need to be met by vendors in order to sell or compete to sell, information technology to the U.S. government. However, Section 508 does not apply to commercial web pages.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 1998 Amendments required the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (the Access Board) to set the standards for Section 508 accessibility compliance. The result of the effort by the Access Board is a set of standards for accessible information technology (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>). Section 1194.22 provides the standards for accessible web-based intranet and internet information and applications.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Center for Information Technology Accommodation (CITA), in the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), operates the official U.S. government website (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.section508.gov/"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.section508.gov/</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>) that provides information about Section 508 compliance. The website provides information to educate Federal employees on how to build the infrastructure necessary to support Section 508 implementation. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>) are the W3C recommendations on web content accessibility.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are Section 508 and WCAG Comparable?</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Access Board and W3C Web Accessibility Initiative must have been aware of each other, it appears that these guidelines were developed independently. A helpful and detailed comparison of Section 508 and WCAG by Jim Thatcher an independent consultant can be found at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.jimthatcher.com/sidebyside.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.jimthatcher.com/sidebyside.htm</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>. While the two standards are similar, WCAG appears to be somewhat more restrictive and prescriptive than Section 508.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How is Accessibility Compliance Marked?</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many U.S. government websites have an accessibility information page. For example, see Social Security Online (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/accessibility.htm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.ssa.gov/accessibility.htm</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>), or FirstGov, the official portal of the U.S. government (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.firstgov.gov/About/Important_Notices.shtml"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.firstgov.gov/About/Important_Notices.shtml#accessibility</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>). The focus of so-called accessibility pages is on people not machines, robots, or agent applications.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the past few months, I have asked several U.S. government web content stewards whether there is interest in tagging an accessibility element on an item-level basis, and heard no interest in doing so. I believe that a clear use scenario for such tagging needs to be articulated before there will be interest in marking content in this way. It is also important to point out that in the U.S. there is not yet a requirement that Federal agencies provide any metadata on web pages. However, this is likely to change as implementation guidelines for the E-Government Act of 2002 are being formalized. For example, see the Statement of Requirements for Search Interoperability (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.search.gov/interop/requirements.html"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.search.gov/interop/requirements.html</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>) drafted by the Categorization of Government Information (CGI) Working Group of the U.S. Federal Interagency Committee on Government Information.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a relationship between accessibility and general usability. Perhaps accessibility is the core type of usability. There could be some interesting implications to begin thinking about usability in this way, particularly in regards to methods for testing and validating usability.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accessibility Metadata: Matching the Needs of the Learner</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jutta Treviranus</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre has proposed a re-definition of disability in the e-learning context. Disability can be defined as a mismatch between the learner needs and the education offered. It is therefore not a personal trait but an artifact of the relationship between the learner and the learning environment or education delivery. Accessibility given this re-definition is the ability of the learning environment to adjust to the needs of all learners. Accessibility is determined by the flexibility of the education environment and the availability of adequate alternative-but-equivalent content and activities. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To promote accessibility in e-learning the ATRC has participated in and lead activities in association with IMS and other interoperability specifications groups to develop specifications that support a better match between the learner needs and the education provided. The first activity is the development of the AccessForAll or ACCLIP specification. This allows the learner to state how they wish to have learning resources displayed, how they wish to control them and what alternative-but-equivalent content and learner scaffolds they require. See: </FONT><A HREF="http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/index.cfm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>http://www.imsglobal.org/accessibility/index.cfm</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To create a successful match to these stated learner needs, learning resources require the appropriate Metadata. To develop this Metadata the Accessibility Profile Working Group within IMS with the participation of Dublin Core, CEN and IEEE have drafted a proposed Metadata specification. This specification drafts a common language to state the flexibility of the primary resource (e.g., can the text size and colour be changed, can it be controlled with a keyboard as well as a mouse), point to any known equivalents and to describe equivalent resources in a way that matches the learner statement of preferences or needs in ACCLIP (e.g., is an English verbatim caption for video y). </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ATRC has implemented both the ACCLIP and the proposed Metadata specification in the TILE project. A Preference Wizard guides the learner through a number of functional questions to create an ACCLIP profile. This is used to deliver learning objects from a learning object repository that supports the Metadata specification.

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1. The aim of the workshop is to identify and investigate the way in which metadata can help achieve efficient and future-proof solutions to accessibility. It is assumed that this encompasses the provision of adequate access to information for people with disabilities and for everyone in a multilingual and multicultural environment. In order to make this perceived information useful, it must be represented within an architecture which allows the accessibility requirements to be questioned in more than one way. Such an architecture must enable both the core system to adapt to new and changing representation requirements, and to allow (theoretically) infinite user requirements.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2. People compress information. People decompress information. The compression procedure</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">involves filtering out redundant information based on the perspective of the user. How do we decide which redundant data entities are relevant for the user? What to use? On what requirements are these redundant data entities based? Whose requirements? How do we marry the existence of these <I>accessibility</FONT><FONT FACE="ArialMS,Times New Roman" SIZE=3> </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>metadata entities with the requirements as described in &quot;common&quot; metadata entities?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More importantly, how do we ensure a synchronised and therefore valid coupling between <I>any </I>kind of content with these metadata entities? How do we ensure that any metatags themselves remain accessible? What is the</FONT><FONT FACE="ArialMS,Times New Roman" SIZE=3> </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>contex</FONT><FONT FACE="ArialMS,Times New Roman" SIZE=3>t </I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>of any accessibility metatags that are to be conceived? As Sarah Currier1 points out in her recent article;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;<I>These developments could be said to deal with the structure of the metadata, where I</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">am concerned with the creation of the content of the metadata fields in describing</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">learning materials. Once a metadata standard has been implemented within a system,</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the specified fields must be filled out with real data about real resources, and this process</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">brings its own problems.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How then can we make sure the context stays consistent?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3. If we describe the knowledge that is applied to enable processes to exist in a digital system that parallels analogue organizational systems, knowledge is transferred from the individual participants to a shared information framework. The use of knowledge can be separated into three parts: the body of information that is contained <I>inside </I>knowledge structures; <I>static </I>information about the knowledgeprocessing, which is also known as meta-information or metatags; <I>dynamic </I>information that is used to describe the processes and procedures to retrieve, transform or use the content. By introducing metatags that aim to address the needs for accessible information processing, it is mandatory to describe the procedures that will meaningfully interpret these metatags to communicate the content in a way which enables every person to appreciate the content. Creating meaningful mappings between</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">the static redundant information -the metatags- and the dynamic processes</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4. Many people believe structure to be static: from a metamodelling perspective this is not the case. It is well known that if the representation of the information at hand is perceived by the system and mapped onto a framework, the information is then usable in a multitude of ways: and for this reason non-programmers will often promote the use of XML. However, this markup and the set of tools which surround it are simply a set of tools which exist to achieve this objective. If the architecture of the system does not answer the wider range of needs, requirements and questions, the markup cannot paper over the cracks. In order to build extensibility into a system, the architecture should be such that every element used for processing the information is adaptable. This can be achieved by building a representation layer which builds an object oriented structure from the information and which is free to adapt the meta relationships and hierarchies intrinsic in that data genus. This is defined by identifying the parameters upon which the structure is built, and ensuring they are interconnected in such a way that promotes future adaptability without degrading the system: which is to say, using the right parameters for accessible information processing.</P>

</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5. The goal should be to anticipate the changes in user requirements. These changes can occur in the very nature of the requirements, such as new functional groups or in the definition of the existing requirements, such as additional details. These aims should be pursued by</FONT><FONT FACE="ArialMS,Times New Roman" SIZE=3> </FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>adding </I>redundant information in the form of metatags, thus augmenting the quality of the content. The content itself and the existing metatag structures, including their mapping to the metamodelling domain, is not allowed to change. From a metamodelling perspective, this allows us to meet changing requirements for the future, because if the requirements demand additional detail in the form of features or metadata, we can unveil the metadata that is available. Such a system architecture allows us to deduce where the dynamic structures have to be taken in by analyzing the static configuring structure. As systems are developed, the static configuring structures also exist to overview the processes and the relations between processes which can be used for future or similar developments in relation to user requirements.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario 1</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Samantha is a working mother, working part-time as an Educational Support Worker in a university.  She has two broad areas of responsibility:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Assessing the educational needs of students with disabilities across her university</LI>
<LI>Providing support to individual students tailored to meet their particular needs</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this work Samantha supports students with a wide range of disabilities: physical, sensory, and specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia.  She also has to work across all the curricular of the university which are usually in subjects she has no background in.  She often has to mediate between the educators and the students to find the balance between technical and human support and appropriate accommodations that best enables the course’s learning objectives to be achieved by that student.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Samantha’s role is a demanding one; there is always a greater call on her skills and time than her contracted hours allow for.  Samantha’s time would be more focused on the key issues and her role would be made more efficient if some things that could be facilitated by accessibility metadata were in place within her university.</P>
<OL>

<LI>If there was a computer tool that when she undertook an assessment of the needs of a student in their use of a computer in their studies, that this information was stored in a standardised way.  Further that throughout the computer facilities at the university when any student logged on that machine would automatically configured in a way that met their particular needs.</LI>
<LI>That there was tool available to her that when a student with disabilities first approached that university enquiring about a particular course or when they registered that she was able to run on all the online components of that course.  Such a tool would automatically generate a report highlighting which components of the course may create accessibility problems for that individual student.  Such a tool would enable Samantha to focus her efforts on working with the student and the relevant educators to find the appropriate ways to address these.</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scenario 2</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doris is a 76 year old lady with failing eyesight.  She has been recently widowed and needs to find out information about probate (this is the legal term in the UK used to describe the legal process where the belongings of a person who has died are transferred to those who inherit).  She goes to her local library to find out and it pointed to the government information service available on computers in the library.  Someone sits with her and assists her to find what she needs.  Firstly the assistant adjusts the display so that she can see what is on the screen (this data is then stored in the profile for this user).  When searching for the information on probate the assistant is able to include in the enquiry terms relating to language density and transformability to focus the search for information that is particularly geared towards Doris’ needs and not that targeted at legal professionals for example.  Suitable content was found and having been reviewed on the screen a large print version was produced for Doris to take with her as reference.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of this positive experience of using a computer to find information Doris signs up to an introductory course on computers at the library.  Her profile is stored so the machine she uses at the library for this course is automatically configured for her.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So the metadata requirements to enable this scenario are:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<OL>

<LI>A means of recording user profiles<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Metadata on the content that allows for the recording of data on Language density and Transformability</LI></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Outstanding issues</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<OL>

<LI>Issue of ‘trust’ where a 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Party captions, annotates a piece of content.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Issue of quality control  (Who/how/why would the meta-data produced)</LI></UL>

<LI>Accessible to who?</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Tension between the idealistic &quot;access for all&quot; and the perceived needs of the known users of a particular leaning object or other content</LI></UL>

<LI>Most teachers are content users not content authors</LI>
<LI>Need to make the benefits known to those who have to put the effort into meeting the accessibility criteria</LI>
<LI>Need a means to integrate the non electronic alternatives activities</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Is this a Metadata Issue or best dealt with by good practice guides?</LI></UL>

<LI>The issue of will the metadata actually be filled out so that envisaged use cases become realistically possible</LI>
<LI>The use case scenarios generated this morning all seem to point to tough problems – is metadata really going to solve these</LI>
<LI>There are fundamental limits to accessibility and in these cases we need to explore what alternative provision being made</LI>
<LI>Metadata can enable us to flag where there are real issues for disability in a particular case</LI>
<LI>Encourage the use of profiles to generate &quot;ACCLIP&quot; data to test things under development</LI></OL>
