<B><P>Introduction</B>       </P>

<P>CEN/ISSS (European Committee for Standardization / Information Society Standardization System) provides market players with a comprehensive and integrated range of standardization services and products, in order to contribute to the success of the Information Society in Europe. </P>

<P>ISSS provides a middle way, an open process combining the tried and tested backing of the formal standardization environment with a fast, market-driven approach.  CEN/ISSS draws on the best of both worlds, bridging the gap between formal and informal standardization, combining the rapid process of informal specification with the security offered by the formal open consensus of traditional standardization.</P>

<P>In addition to formal CEN Technical Committees, CEN/ISSS provides a less formal environment through CEN/ISSS Workshops. These ongoing working groups offer the opportunity for direct participation in the standardization process. CEN/ISSS Workshops aim to arrive at a European consensus on an issue that can be published as a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA). These deliverables may take the form of best practice agreements, codes of conduct or pre-standards, with the formal backing of CEN, one of the three European Standardization Organisations.</P>

<P>One of the workshops is MMI-DC  - CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia Information - Dublin Core. </P>

<B><P>Introduction to MMI-DC Workshop</B>      </P>
<P>Presentation by Robina Clayphan, chairman MMI-DC</P>

<P>Evolving from an earlier, more generalised metadata activity the MMI-Dublin Core workshop has now been in existence for over five years. Recognising that DC was becoming the de facto metadata standard for cross-sectoral resource discovery we have been providing a European open forum in which DC metadata related issues can be addressed. The workshop's activities are complementary to the work done within the international DCMI with whom we maintain a close relationship. With European Commission funding our projects have produced several deliverables that aim to support the consistent development and deployment of interoperable resource description. Our work in 2004 includes the production of CEN workshop agreements in the areas of metadata for e-government, knowledge organisation in corporate environments, interoperablility of application profiles and metadata issues related to accessibility. We also update earlier guidance material in line with latest practice.</P>

<B><P>Work item 1: Revision of CWA 13899: General guidance for the deployment of Dublin Core Metadata (CWA)</P>
</B><P>Project team: Thomas Baker and Makx Dekkers</P>

<P>Presentation of the main elements of the Draft CWA on "Guidance information for the deployment of Dublin Core metadata", particularly outlining the roadmap to Dublin Core documentation and a number of issues of interest to novice implementers.</P>
<BR> <BR>
<B><P>Work item 2: Further development, guidance and promotion related to the EU e-government Metadata Framework</P>
</B><P>Project team: Themis Tambouris, Martin Ford and Makx Dekkers.</P>

<P>In the light of the European Community expanding by 10 countries this year, and the desire to get government online by 2005 in accordance with the Action Plan, Work Item 2 centres on a harmonised metadata platform for e-Government.  It refers to the CWAs supporting interoperability completed last year and two further CWAs that are currently in preparation.</P>

<P>The Framework CWA includes the importance of metadata for interoperability at the national and European level as well as a hierarchical structure with one European standard and different Member State standards (all based on DC) that are compatible at all times.</P>

<P>The Deployment CWA presents an overview of the Framework (for completeness) and states the actions that should be taken at the European level for establishing and implementing the European standard.  It presents simple guidelines for Member States with a national standard to comply to the European one and references last year's CWA "Best Practice" for Member States without a national standard that want to build following the guidelines.</P>

<P>The outcome of the Government Information Interoperability workshop that was held in Zaragoza on 3 September 2004 and a summary of possible further activities in this area will be presented.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Work item 3: Guidance for the deployment of Dublin Core Metadata in corporate environments</P>
</B><P>Project team: Joseph Busch, Makx Dekkers and Kerstin Forsberg</P>

<P>Presentation of the draft CEN Workshop Agreement on Guidance for the deployment of Dublin Core metadata in corporate environments, specifically concentrating on how DC metadata is used, how DC is extended, what tools are being used to create and maintain metadata and which controlled vocabularies are used. Also, some of the issues identified will be highlighted with case studies that were assembled during the preparation of the draft CWA.</P>

<P>Participants in the meeting will have the opportunity to comment on the results and contribute their experience.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Work item 4: Application Profiles - guidelines for machine-readable representation and for naming, versioning, evolution and maintenance</P>
</B><P>Project team: Thomas Baker, Rachel Heery, Makx Dekkers, Erik Duval, Thomas Fischer and Martin Ford.</P>

<P>Guidelines for machine-processable representation: The underlying aim of declaring DC Application Profiles is to support interoperability by describing an application's use of the Dublin Core Grammatical Principles. This presentation will outline recent work on a CWA offering guidelines for machine-processable representation of DC Application Profiles. This work is intended to support exchange of DC Application Profiles between applications and the presentation will explore various usage scenarios to illustrate the benefits of this approach.</P>

<P>Guidelines for naming, versioning, evolution and maintenance: The very idea of a Semantic Web presupposes widely understood conventions for identifying and declaring the semantic concepts such as metadata elements in a way that is universally referencable. With its so-called Namespace Policy (regarding the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers, or URIs, for identifying metadata terms), the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative provides the useful example of a simple policy for a small vocabulary of terms. This presentation will discuss how DCMI identifies terms, versions of terms, and application profiles in the context of the broader DCMI approach to managing a small metadata vocabulary.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Work item 5: Investigation of metadata issues and approaches in the area of accessibility and multilingual information</P>
</B><P>Project team: Liddy Nevile and Martin Ford Consultancy</P>

<P>Accessibility has become an over used term with many conflicting definitions. This work item defines the term as access to resources for all at all times in all places. Regardless of race creed culture language or disability, everyone should have access to the same resources. Accessibility, as defined in this work, is about matching people to resources. This report places the building blocks to making the Web more accessible to more people in a shorter space of time by working with existing communities. This presentation brings the first requirements to achieving accessibility at all times to all people in all places through the use of metadata.</P>
