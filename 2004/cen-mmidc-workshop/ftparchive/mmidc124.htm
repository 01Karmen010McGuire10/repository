</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Declaration of Contribution-in-Kind to MMI-DC Workshop Tasks</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>The work of MMI-DC is supported by funding from the European Commission.  To justify this funding we have to demonstrate the support of stakeholders in the standardisation community by showing an equal amount of voluntary effort from interested parties.  This is achieved by recording &quot;Contributions-in-Kind&quot;.  If we cannot satisfy this condition our full grant will not be paid and it will lead to reduced payments to the experts contracted to do the work.  </P>

<P>To prove the required level of contributions-in-kind we do two things:</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>keep well documented meeting attendance lists</LI>
<LI>collect declarations of effort that has been made outside meetings</LI></OL>


<P>We would therefore ask you to use this form to declare any effort you have contributed so we can record it accurately.  We have to supply a &quot;reasonably detailed breakdown of the man days spent&quot; so the different kinds of activity that are acceptable are shown on the form below.</P>

<P>If your contribution to the Workshop is funded by another Commission funded project (for instance an IST-project), then this must be indicated – it cannot be counted twice. </P>

<P>The information that has been provided on this form will not be used for any other purpose than for justifying the contributions in kind related to the MMI-DC Grant Agreement.</P>

<B><P>The declarations have to be signed!  </B>This must be the signature of the experts themselves or their superior.  There are two ways to do this:</P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>the form should be printed off, dated, signed and posted or faxed to the address below</LI>
<LI>email a PDF/JPEG/etc file containing the scanned image of the signed declaration</LI></OL>
