<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>DCMI Call for Feedback: Mapping from Dublin Core terms to W3C PROV ontology</strong></span><br /><strong>Feedback Deadline: 7 April 2013</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/provenance/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata Provenance Task Group</a> is collaborating with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/prov/wiki/Main_Page">W3C Provenance Working Group</a> on a mapping from Dublin Core terms to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-prov-dc-20130312/" target="_blank">PROV provenance ontology</a>, currently a <em>W3C Proposed Recommendation</em>. More precisely, the document describes a partial mapping from <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" target="_blank">DCMI Metadata  Terms</a> to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank">PROV-O OWL2 ontology</a>&mdash;a set of classes and properties usable for representing and interchanging information about provenance. Numerous terms in the DCMI vocabulary provide information about the provenance of a resource. Translating these terms into PROV relates this information explicitly to the W3C provenance model.</p>

<p>The mapping is currently a <em>W3C Working Draft</em>. The final state of the document will be that of a <em>W3C Note</em>, to be published as part of a suite of documents in support of a <em>W3C Recommendation</em> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/" target="_blank">provenance interchange</a>.</p>

<p>DCMI would like to point to the <em>W3C Note</em> as a <em>DCMI Recommended Resource</em> and therefore encourages the Dublin Core community to provide feedback and take part in the finalization of the mapping.</p>

<p>The deadline for all feedback is 7 April 2013. We recommend that feedback be provided directly to the public W3C list for comments: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-prov-comments/" target="_blank">public-prov-comments@w3.org</a>, ideally with a Cc: to <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=dc-provenance" target="_blank">DCMI's dc-provenance list</a>. However, feedback sent only the dc-provenance list will be summarized on the W3C list and addressed, and discussions on the W3C list will be summarized back on the dc-provenance list when appropriate.</p>
