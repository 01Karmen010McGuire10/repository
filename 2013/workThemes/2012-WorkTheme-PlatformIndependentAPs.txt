<p><strong>Platform-independent Application Profiles</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/">DCMI Abstract Model</a> (DCAM), published as a DCMI 
Recommendation in 2007, provides an abstract syntax for packaging Semantic-Web-compatible data in validatable 
record formats. DCAM was designed to bridge the modern paradigm of the unbounded Linked Data graph and the 
more familiar paradigm of the validatable metadata record, locally managed and constrained using a myriad of 
software platforms and implementation technologies. For five years, DCAM has inspired a wide range of deployment 
experiences, and the core RDF standards themselves continue to be extended. The activity "platform-independent 
application profiles" is re-evaluating the need and requirements for a common language to express metadata design 
patterns, both as templates for Linked-Data-compatible data formats and as reference points for creating and 
consuming coherent metadata within communities of discourse and practice.</p>
