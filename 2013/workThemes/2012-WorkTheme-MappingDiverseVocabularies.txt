<p><strong>Mapping Diverse Vocabularies</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While DCMI Metadata Terms and other core vocabularies increase the coherence of metadata by providing 
shared reference points, the unavoidable proliferation of diverse but overlapping vocabularies threatens 
to create metadata silos. A key part of the solution is to create machine-readable mappings. The activity 
"mapping diverse vocabularies" aims at mapping DCMI metadata terms to related terms in other vocabularies. 
In the absence of well-established practices for publishing and maintaining such mappings, this activity 
aspires to establish a workflow and publication practices that can be adopted by other vocabulary maintainers. 
The starting point for this activity is a mapping to the terms defined by the Schema.org initiative.</p>
