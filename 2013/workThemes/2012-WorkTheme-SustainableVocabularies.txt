<p><strong>Sustainable Vocabularies</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a foundation for applications, the value of any given vocabulary depends on the perceived certainty 
that the vocabulary&mdash;both its machine-readable schemas and human-readable specification documents&mdash;will 
remain reliably accessible over time and that its URIs will not be sold, re-purposed, or simply forgotten. 
In order to raise awareness of this issue, DCMI has formulated an agreement with the FOAF Project, 
which is owned by individuals, with contingency plans for transferring maintenance control in the short 
or long term should exigent circumstances require. This activity examines the issues around vocabulary 
sustainability and governance with the goal of formulating best practices and, ultimately, of ensuring 
that our vocabularies will be preserved by society's long-term memory institutions.</p>
