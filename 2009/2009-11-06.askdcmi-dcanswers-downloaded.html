        <br/>
          As part of the makeover for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's online news site the project team have developed a profile of the Dublin Core standard (with some additional elements, and customised value lists) for describing its news objects (stories, images etc.).  <br /><br />We have used Dublin Core encoding standard for mixing Dublin Core and non Dublin core metadata as a guide for embedding this metadata record in an HTML/XHTML web page.  While this all seemed pretty straightforward, we are not sure what is involved in declaring a namespace for the ABC's custom elements and value lists.  Currently, we have no expression of these in RDF, or a metadata register other than a spreadsheet.  Is it acceptable for the ABC to use a URI which resolves back to a page on our website which includes a PDF (that functions as a reference guide) with the ABC's custom elements and value lists?<br /><br />I can send through a copy of our intended reference guide if this is useful.<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />Lizbeth Moore<br />ABC Metadata Registry Group | AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION | address GPO Box 9994 SYDNEY 2001 | email moore.lizbeth@abc.net.au | phone +612 8333 2524

	Lizbeth: <br /> <br />There is a draft DCMI recommendation that might be helpful to you: "Guidelines for assigning identifiers to metadata terms" available at <br />http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/term-identifier-guidelines/  You will note that it is dated a few years ago and has not progressed to a recommendation but there are reasons for this that are not related to the validity of the advice, so I think you can use it with confidence. <br /> <br />I think it's great that you are going about your project with attention to standards and interoperability, but as you've no doubt recognized, there are no well-lighted paths yet to achieve all of your goals in that regard. I think the plan you've articulated in your question, using a URI that resolves to a webpage, is a perfectly adequate initial step along the way.  I get the feeling that you recognize that there are probably better alternative, given that you're likely to modify and change your vocabularies over time, and I hope you'll follow through on those intentions and move to a fuller registry for your terms as those become available. <br /> <br />On additional point: DCMI usually doesn't recommend embedding metadata in webpages, given that most search engines don't use them (thanks to the spammers) and they're very difficult to scale and manage over time using embedded HTML or XHTML.  <br /> <br />Good luck with your project! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <div class="h4">Question asked on: 2007-03-17 00:00:00 by Mike</div>
        <br/>
          How do I put the place of publication of a book into the Dublin Core record?  Do I use the coverage element?
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2007-04-01 17:12:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Mike, <br /> <br />The answer to this depends on whether the place that the resource was published is relevant to the resource itself, or just the publishing entity.  In other words, the place of publication automatically noted in a MARC record does not automatically map to DC:Coverage. <br /> <br />If you look at the definition for Coverage, you'll see that this is so: "The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant."  The question you need to ask, therefore, is whether this place of publication tells you something about the topic, the jurisdiction of application, or the spatial applicability.  Otherwise, the place is an attribute of the publishing company, not the resource you're describing. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane <br />

        <br/>
          When filling in values (not encoded) for the relation element, best practices recommend using a string or number from a formal identification system to identify the referenced resource.  How should these numbers be indicated?  For example, if I choose to use an ISBN, what is the standard format for showing that it is an ISBN rather than another number combination?

        <br/>
          Thank you for your timely responses to my previous questions!  I recently asked for an example of a Dublin Core record, using Malcolm Gladwell's book &quot;Blink&quot; as the example. <br /><br />I am having difficulty understanding DC because there seem to be no complete examples given anywhere.  I understand that it can change, depending on individual needs.<br /><br />However, it would help me greatly if someone could show what a typical reocrd looks like, whether it be simple or qualified.  Which is used most frequently and why would one be chosen over another?   <br /><br />I assume, for my purposes that XHTML is what I want but am not entirely sure of the differences.  What would be best for use when learning how to use DC?<br /><br />I apologize for the number of questions!  Thank you again for all the help.

	Pallas: <br /> <br />I've included some examples below:  note that they are not the book you asked for, and they are not fully encoded XML (they lack namespace declarations and schema locations), but include I think what you're looking for. <br /> <br />I suspect that the Simple DC is more prevalent, particularly since OAI-PMH (the Open Archives Initiate Protocol for Metadata Harvesting), requires it as a minimum standard. For most purposes where designated vocabularies are needed, it's not sufficient. <br /> <br />For more learning materials, check out the DCMI website (http://dublincore.org) and look for the usage guide and the tutorials (under training materials). <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane<br /><br />XML Code<br /><br /><br /><pre>Simple DC Example: &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:title&amp;gt;Metadata in practice.&amp;lt;/dc:title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:contributor&amp;gt;Hillmann, Diane I.&amp;lt;/dc:contributor&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:contributor&amp;gt;Westbrooks, Elaine L.&amp;lt;/dc:contributor&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject&amp;gt;Information organization&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject&amp;gt;Metadata&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject&amp;gt;Database management&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject&amp;gt;Z666.5.M48 2004&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject&amp;gt;035.3&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:date&amp;gt;2004&amp;lt;/dc:date&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:format&amp;gt;285 p.&amp;lt;/dc:format&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:type&amp;gt;Text&amp;lt;/dc:type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:identifier&amp;gt;ISBN:0838908829&amp;lt;/dc:identifier&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:language&amp;gt;en&amp;lt;/dc:language&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:publisher&amp;gt;ALA Editions&amp;lt;/dc:publisher&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/metadata&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Qualified DC Example: &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;metadata&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:title xml:lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Metadata in practice.&amp;lt;/dc:title&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:contributor&amp;gt;Hillmann, Diane I.&amp;lt;/dc:contributor&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:contributor&amp;gt;Westbrooks, Elaine L.&amp;lt;/dc:contributor&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject xsitype=&amp;quot;LCSH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Information organization&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject xsitype=&amp;quot;LCSH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Metadata&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject xsitype=&amp;quot;LCSH&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Database management&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject xsitype=&amp;quot;LCC&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Z666.5.M48 2004&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:subject xsitype=&amp;quot;DDC&amp;quot;&amp;gt;035.3&amp;lt;/dc:subject&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:date xsitype=&amp;quot;W3CDTF&amp;quot;&amp;gt;2004&amp;lt;/dc:date&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dcterms:extent&amp;gt;285 p.&amp;lt;/dcterms:extent&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:type xsitype=&amp;quot;DCMIType&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Text&amp;lt;/dc:type&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:identifier xsitype=&amp;quot;URI&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ISBN:0838908829&amp;lt;/dc:identifier&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:language xsitype=&amp;quot;RFC3066&amp;quot;&amp;gt;en&amp;lt;/dc:language&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dc:publisher&amp;gt;ALA Editions&amp;lt;/dc:publisher&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dcterms:audience&amp;gt;Librarians&amp;lt;/dcterms:audience&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/metadata&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;</pre>

          What would a Dublin Core Record look like for the book &quot;Blink&quot;, written by Malcolm Gladwell?

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2007-03-10 17:43:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Pallas: <br /> <br />That would depend on a number of variables. First would be whether you're interested in Simple Dublin Core (the original 15 elements) or Qualified Dublin Core, which includes a number of refinements and allows more specific use of controlled vocabularies. <br /> <br />Then, of course, you'd have choices about encoding, whether XHTML, XML or RDF.  So it's not so easy to answer your question! <br /> <br />One way to try and explore what the options are, and incidentally get some simple examples, is to try out the DC-Dot metadata generator (see: http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/) and see what it comes up with. Unfortunately it requires a URL to begin, so you'll need to select an online resource, but you can select any encoding, and also edit the output. <br /> <br />I hope this helps. <br /> <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Dear DC community,<br /><br />I'm working for an ejournal publishing scholarly book reviews. We would like to encode metadata information of each review in an RSS feed. As there is no specific RSS element to encode the ISBN of the book(s) reviewed in these articles, I thought of including an appropriate DC element (by namespace) for encoding such ISBNs.<br /><br />Unfortunately I don't find any recommendation or best practise WHICH DC element to use for that purpose. <br />So my question is: Which DC element could I use? <br /><br />Please consider that I don't want to provide a metadata set of the book itself, but a metadata set of a book review in which I want to include the ISBN(s) of the reviewed book(s) (more than one reviewed book are possible).<br /><br />Additionally, it would be interesting how to encode the ISBN in detail. Supposed the appropriate DC element be &quot;dc:relation&quot;: What schema could you recommend? Here some solutions which could make sense:<br /><br />&lt;dc:relation&gt;urn:ISBN:0-123-45678-9&lt;/dc:relation&gt;<br /><br />&lt;dc:relation someAttribute=&quot;ISBN&quot;&gt;0-123-45678-9&lt;/dc:relation&gt;<br /><br />What encoding schema could you recommend? What could be the right attribute in my solution number 2?<br /><br />Any hints or suggestions are very welcome. Thank you very much in advance for your kind help!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Oliver

For example: <br /> <br /><meta name="DC.Source" scheme="URI" content="urn:isbn:1-56592-149-6"> <br /> <br />I hope this is useful to you. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

          Hiya,<br /><br />Can I just check the correct implementation for the 'dc.rights' element.

	<p>
	Jennifer <br /> <br />It would be fine to use a statement such as the one you propose, but it might be good to include a term designating the rights you're claiming rather than leave that all to your linked information.  If it's copyright, just include that at the head of your statement. <br /> <br />If you have some need to separate the parts of the statement, you should do that, but do note that you've then gone into the realm of Qualified DC, and you then need to pay attention to the fact that this puts you into a separate namespace, and "dc.rights.owner" and "dc.rights.URI" are both incorrect expressions. Ergo, it's best to stick to the simple alternative! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

          I&#180;d like to implement DC metadata to an electronic journal published by a medical society (http://saei.org). Every issue of this journal is a set of short comments about their respective original articles published in other resources.<br />Terms as creator, subject, publisher, date, language, etc are commons to all the comments, but I do not know how to specify a title, a contributor and a source for each item (i.e. for each comment). How can I do this in the head DC metadata and in the respective RDF file (one file for each issue, not for each comment).

	Javier: <br /> <br />It might be useful to recall that nothing in DC is required, so if the title, contributor and source aren't obvious to you, it's likely that you don't need them.  <br /> <br />I'm not exactly sure what you mean in the last portion of your question: "How can I do this in the head DC metadata and in the respective RDF file (one file for each issue, not for each comment."  If you are using only a subset of the available elements, rest assured that this is fine and you need not justify the absence of an element that is theoretically available.

        <br/>
          Hello DCMI gurus,<br /><br />I'm looking for descriptions, in layman's terms, of some of the Dublin Core Elements so I can equate them to an image database I've built. I've looked at the DC reference descriptions, but I was unable to parse them for the following terms.<br /><br />Is &quot;Format&quot; comparable to what an art historian might call &quot;medium&quot;, eg, painting, drawing, sculpture?<br /><br />Is &quot;Identifier&quot; comparable to what a curator might call an accession #?<br /><br />I'm guessing &quot;Source&quot; could be identified as the book from which a VR curator might have scanned an image? Yes, no?<br /><br />Could I equate &quot;Publisher&quot; with a museum that holds the original artwork from which my digital image is derived?<br /><br />I don't understand the definition of &quot;Type&quot; in the DC reference description. Can you give an example? Ditto for &quot;Relation&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br />

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2007-01-30 16:07:00 by  Holly Mercer</div>  
	<p>
	Hello Suzanne,<br />Format is comparable to Medium; in fact, Medium is an element refinement (or qualifier) of Format.  Accession Number would be a locally-assigned Identifier.  Source could be identified as the book from which an image is obtained; include the citation and page number.<br /><br />It is important to keep the 1-1 principle in mind when applying Dublin Core metadata: The principle whereby related but conceptually different entities, for example a painting and a digital image of the painting, are described by separate metadata records.  In your example, Publisher would refer to the entity responsible for making the digital image available.  You could then use the Relation element to show the relationship of the digital image to the original artwork.<br /><br />I highly recommend consulting Diane Hillman's "Using Dublin Core" <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/">http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/</a>. It is a usage guide that includes definitions, descriptions, and usage examples. Sections 4 & 5 may be particularly helpful, and may further clarify how to use the Dublin Core elements.  Best of luck on your project. <br /><br />Regards,<br />Holly

        <br/>
          Hi, I am doing a research about LO metadata and I found some papers that consider 15 elements for the dublin core specification  (http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/), and others with 22 elements (http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml)<br />how many elements should I consider?<br />Thanks<br />Patricia

	Patricia: <br /> <br />Dublin Core comes in two "flavors." Simple Dublin Core consists of 15 elements only, but Qualified Dublin Core is richer, and includes element refinements and methods to specify controlled vocabularies. Unfortunately, there's still quite a bit of confusion about this but DCMI is attempting to clarify the situation. <br /> <br />In any case, you can find all terms recommended by DCMI at: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/ <br /> <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <br/>
          Hello DCMI,<br /><br />I'm confused about dc:author - I can see many uses of this on the web (http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dc:author) but no mention of it in http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/. Is it a valid element? Was it once valid but dropped in favour of dc:creator?<br /><br />Kevin.

	<p>
	Hello Kevin! <br /> <br />Your suspicion is correct, dc:author is not valid Dublin Core, and never was.  I'm afraid that since the beginning, some implementors have completely misunderstood DC and believed that calling some element they wanted to use a "dc" element could make it so. That's certainly not the case! <br /> <br />However, because "creator" is only the name of the element, and not necessarily the label that must be used when displaying the information to users, there's no real need to argue. But it's extremely important to interoperability to be firm about using the same element names, not matter your decisions about display labels. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          What are the biggest advantages for using DC over MARC for cataloguing digital objects?  
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2007-01-05 15:15:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Shan, <br /> <br />I don't think it's really possible to come up with generalized arguments about the advantages or disadvantages outside the context of a particular implementation. For some projects, MARC makes more sense, and for others, DC is more useful.   <br /> <br />One consideration that may be relevant is whether the project is implemented within a library where MARC data is already available for material that is being digitized.  If the library can more easily manage MARC data and can find an efficient way to re-use the MARC data for the digitized material, that might be better.  If, on the other hand, there are no precursor resources with reusable data, DC may be easier to implement, given its overall simplicity and shorter learning curve. <br /> <br />In short: one size does not fit all, and we always suggest that decisions on metadata format be based on thorough analysis of project needs. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Dear all,<br /><br />does the &quot;location of a recording&quot; fit to DC-element ref. &quot;Coverage spatial&quot;, since it can be separated from the recording content on spatial concerns? Example: Nigerian music recorded in London.<br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Michael Fuhr
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2007-01-05 14:54:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Michael: <br /> <br />The definition and comment for Coverage provides some of the answer to your question: <br /> <br />Definition: 	The spatial or temporal topic of the resource, the spatial applicability of the resource, or the jurisdiction under which the resource is relevant. <br /> <br />Comment: 	Spatial topic may be a named place or a location specified by its geographic coordinates. Temporal period may be a named period, date, or date range. A jurisdiction may be a named administrative entity or a geographic place to which the resource applies. Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as the Thesaurus of Geographic Names [TGN]. Where appropriate, named places or time periods can be used in preference to numeric identifiers such as sets of coordinates or date ranges. <br /> <br />It seems to me that, if you use Coverage for both the "topic"--which in your example would be Nigeria--and the place where the recording was made, you risk filling your search results with information that most of your users would not find useful. Now, recognizing that your users are better known to you than to me, this might be an incorrect reading, but certainly if you plan to distribute this information outside a particular community of those more interested in the music than the recording of music, the same concern applies. <br /> <br />One better way of dealing with the location of recording is to set up a controlled list of recording entities, with associated locations, and use the entity names in "Publisher" or "Contributor." This would allow you to enable more specific access to the details of recording without muddling up the topicality of the resources with technical information. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Thank you for your answer.<br /><br />Would you mind to shed some light on the actual implementation of DCMIType terms?<br />Even though this project is for personal use at this stage, it's ment as kind of a study for a larger project. For this reason you could say I'm looking at it from a film library perspective.<br />The best thing I could come up with, dealing with the issues mentioned in my original question, is the following:<br /><br />&lt;release&gt;<br />&lt;dc:title&gt;American Beauty&lt;/dc:title&gt;<br />&lt;dc:medium&gt;dvd&lt;/dc:medium&gt;<br />&lt;dc:identifier xsi:type=&quot;myterm:EAN13&quot;&gt;0678149096026&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;<br />&lt;dc:issued xsi:type=&quot;dcterm:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/dc:issued&gt;<br />&lt;comments/&gt;<br />&lt;dctype:MovingImage&gt;<br />&lt;dc:issued xsi:type=&quot;dcterm:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/dc:issued&gt;<br />&lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;myterm:director&quot;&gt;Sam Mendes&lt;/dc:creator&gt;<br />&lt;/dctype:MovingImage&gt;<br />&lt;/release&gt;<br /><br />This, however, still doesn't feel quite right. The use of e.g. a 'MovingImage' DCMIType term is only suitable in a direct approach while in this context it would require some form of relational link to the 'release'. Only this way does it become clear that the release actually contains the movie.<br />Am I assuming correctly that this is where the 'hasPart' element comes in or should this be used in a different context? The use of the 'hasPart' element would result in:<br /><br />&lt;release&gt;<br />&lt;dc:title&gt;American Beauty&lt;/dc:title&gt;<br />&lt;dc:medium&gt;dvd&lt;/dc:medium&gt;<br />&lt;dc:identifier xsi:type=&quot;myterm:EAN13&quot;&gt;0678149096026&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;<br />&lt;dc:issued xsi:type=&quot;dcterm:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/dc:issued&gt;<br />&lt;comments/&gt;<br />&lt;dc:hasPart&gt;<br />&lt;dctype:MovingImage&gt;<br />&lt;dc:issued xsi:type=&quot;dcterm:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/dc:issued&gt;<br />&lt;dc:creator xsi:type=&quot;myterm:director&quot;&gt;Sam Mendes&lt;/dc:creator&gt;<br />&lt;/dctype:MovingImage&gt;<br />&lt;/dc:hasPart&gt;<br />&lt;/release&gt;<br /><br />Or am I abusing the 'hasPart' element now? If that's the case than I see no other alternative than to create my own relationship element.<br /><br />I can only hope I'm expressing my self clear enough, I'm not a native English speaker.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Age Bosma

	Age: <br /> <br />I think the model of what a "release" is in your film library is not necessarily clear without better context, and consequently it looks to me like you are attempting to use a simple schema and an even simpler set of type terms in ways that seem (to me, at least) a bit complex. <br /> <br />It might be more useful for you to expose some of your thinking in some accessible documentation, then ask on the DC-General list for a bit of conversation with other implementers.  <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Hi,<br /><br />The Encoding Schemes currently available in the DCMI specs are very limited. The value of the 'identifier' element, or 'format' and 'medium' for that manner, doesn't mean much if you don't specify what kind of identifier we are talking about. A scheme I would like to see for one would be e.g. 'EAN-13'. This one can also be used as a replacement for 'ISBN' codes.<br />Are there any plans to extend the amount of Encoding Schemes in the future? If yes, how, when and to what extent?<br /><br />Until that time, what is the recommended practise to specify non-DCMI Encoding Schemes?<br />E.g. currently I'm specifying dates with DC in XML the following way (please correct me if I should do it differently):<br /><br />&lt;dc:issued xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;1999&lt;/dc:issued&gt;<br /><br />In the 'identifier' element I'm storing 'EAN-13' codes the following way:<br /><br />&lt;dc:identifier&gt;8713045200305&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;<br /><br />In what way can I specify that we are dealing with a 'EAN-13' code? I could create my own namespace again:<br /><br />&lt;dc:identifier xsi:type=&quot;myterms:EAN-13&quot;&gt;8713045200305&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;<br /><br />But this seems to me like missing the whole point of a unified metadata spec if everyone starts creating their own bits when dealing with global standards like 'EAN-13' barcodes.<br /><br />Are there already namespaces available for standards like this and others which can be used in combination with DC?<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Age Bosma<br /><br />P.s. I think some additional info is required for people to be able to select a proper 'What is this question for' category. I e.g. don't know what 'Crosswalk' is. Maybe a link next to the dropdown, presenting a pop-up with a description of each group will do the trick. Did I submit these questions to the right group now?

	<p>
	Age: <br /> <br />Yes, agreed--they are very limited. Part of this limitation has to do with recognition by the DCMI that they cannot cover the varied needs of a broad range of communities via a manageable list of encoding schemes. In other words, the list is unlikely to grow, and DCMI is looking at more generalized strategies to support the use of encoding schemes in metadata. <br /> <br />The real challenge to supporting use of encoding schemes, regardless of syntax used, lies in persistent namespaces to a great extent. Given that you wish to use 'EAN-13,' which is a recognized standard, you will need to ascertain the appropriate namespace (you'll need to figure out who the maintenance agency is for EAN-13, and may need to inquire specifically) , declare that in your document, and supply as well a token (such as has been done in your example with 'W3CDTF').  The technique is the same, but you'll have to do a bit more legwork to set it up properly. <br /> <br />Right now, the infrastructure to make these tasks simple is not yet in place, but there is some activity going on that should move us all forward in supporting this work. It's going a bit slower than we'd like, though. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

          When creating metadata for a text book where the chapters are written by different individuals and the book has a number of editors, who should I classify as creators and who as contributors?

	<p>
	Gillian: <br /> <br />There isn't really a one-size-fits-all answer to this question, since it depends entirely on how you want your metadata to function. Some implementors use the distinction between Creator and Contributor to express something about the importance of the role played by different entities, but this distinction is difficult to express and nearly impossible to enforce outside a particular implementation. Since most applications search both together (since even if a metadata creator enforces a distinction, a user is unlikely to understand it, or agree), you might want to clarify for yourself why you need to distinguish, and where. <br /> <br />Some implementors have chosen one or the other element and determined for simplicity's sake, others have chosen more specific roles (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/appendix_roles.shtml) when they feel their users will benefit from that specificity.  <br /> <br />The key is that you make the decision based on the needs of your implementation, and document them so that users of your metadata will understand your decision-making. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

	Yes. You can define new properties and declare that those properties are sub-properties/refinements of any of the properties defined by DCMI, including the "element refinements".It is probably best to think of the concept of "element refinement" in terms of a type of relationship that may exist between two properties, rather than in terms of a category of property.RegardsPete Johnston

          Hi AskDCMI. <br /><br />I'm working in a project in Norway which is implementing DC in a new document system. During this process we have registrated some difficulties during implementing Security Classification (ex. &quot;Top Secret&quot;, &quot;Secret&quot;, &quot;Confidential&quot;, and &quot;Restricted&quot;).

	<p>
	Jarl: <br /> <br />I think the answer to your question can be approached in a number of ways.  One simple method would be to characterize the document itself as to its classification within your security system. For this you might use a controlled vocabulary within the "Access Rights" refinement to the Rights element. <br /> <br />The definition of Access Rights is as follows: <br /> <br />"Information about who can access the resource or an indication of its security status."  <br /> <br />There is also a Comment: "Access Rights may include information regarding access or restrictions based on privacy, security or other regulations." <br /> <br />Obviously, though, you might have a requirement that the system be able to negotiate between a document and a user, where the user has a particular set of security levels and rights to view a certain kind of secure document. It's likely then that the use of "Access Rights" might well solve only half your problem.   <br /> <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <br/>
          Hello,<br /><br />Could you use Dublin Core to describe cats and dogs?  Not photos of the animals but the animals themselves?  An application could be animal shelters where clients can search for the perfect pet.  For example:<br /><br />Title=&quot;Muffin&quot;<br />Subject=&quot;Cat&quot;<br />Description=&quot;Friendly&quot;<br />Description=&quot;Loves to sit on your lap&quot;<br />Type=&quot;Physical object&quot;<br />Type=&quot;Domestic Short Hair&quot;<br />Type=&quot;Female&quot;<br />Source=&quot;Unknown. Orphan kitty.&quot;<br />Date=&quot;2005&quot;<br />Format=&quot;12 lbs.&quot;<br />Format=&quot;Grey and white&quot;<br /><br />Are you aware of any applications that do this?  Thanks very much<br />

	Amy: <br /> <br />I don't see why you couldn't use DC in this context, but I don't know specifically of any implementation that does so.  I think that the key to doing this is not to stretch the elements too far.  Much of what you have in "Format," for instance, might be less problematic as "Description."  The key is probably to pay attention to consistency and document what you do over time. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

It all depends on what your needs are, and what you intend to do with these objects that should indicate what your strategy should be.  Keep in mind that, for the most part, DC data is designed to be easily interpreted by humans, so it might be best, if you're describing the object as a unit, that you be consistent about presenting information about its extent. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

	There are no plans at DCMI to define further refinements of dc:date. Most&nbsp;of our work is now focused on&nbsp;Application Profiles, which provide a context for any new properties.&nbsp;You&nbsp;can of course&nbsp;define&nbsp;your own refinement for your own use and declare it to be a subproperty of dc:date.

          I hope this is the right forum to ask this question. I am a catalog librarian and I'm interested in learning more about DC and metadata in general. Is the DC-2006 conference a good place to do this? If not, does DCMI sponsor or know of any better starting points? Thanks.

	Karen: <br /> <br />The conference is definitely a good place to learn about DC and metadata in general. There will be tutorials, papers, and meetings of interest groups (including the DC-Libraries Working Group).  We've been told by many past attendees that the DC conferences are the best metadata conferences available.  <br /> <br />DCMI does not sponsor other conferences or training sessions, but increasingly libraries and library consortia and associations are doing so.  Unfortunately there's no good central place to find out about these, but they're sometimes advertised on discussion lists. <br /> <br />Good luck, and I hope to see you at DC2006! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

	Robert: <br /> <br />DCMI doesn't keep any central listing of available courses or workshops, so there's nothing I can point you to. If your institution doesn't have anything available, you might check with other libraries and library organizations in your area. <br /> <br />There are slides from tutorials presented at past DCMI conferences available on the website (see: http://dublincore.org/resources/training/), and tutorials will be available at the DC2006 conference in Colima, Mexico this coming fall.  <br /> <br />Of course, if you wanted to organize some training yourself, we'd be happy to put you in touch with someone who might be willing to do the training, if local folks could organize the effort. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

          We are basing an electronic document management metadata standard on Dublin Core. We are having an issue with what element/refinement to use for tracking the version of the document.<br />We have looked at using identifier, hasVersion, modified. Current business practices use date for the chapter of the document being updated but no change in identifier or date of the document as a whole.  We are suggesting the modification of business practices to include a form of versioning within the title section. <br /><br />Any suggestions <br /><br />Thanks<br />Andy Everett<br />Washington State Department of Transportation

	Andy: <br /> <br />The expression of version or edition of documents has long been an area where there is considerable difference of opinion.  Some projects are quite comfortable with expression within the Title element, others prefer a separate Description statement.  <br /> <br />Of the ones you mention, Modified, of course, should contain a date (which is fine if your documents are versioned by date, but doesn't help with other kinds of versioning).  Identifier isn't incorrect, but might tend to create problems when there's a need to distinguish different kinds of identifiers for action or display.  HasVersion refers to another document, not the one being identified. <br /> <br />So, I think you've come up with a viable solution, so go for it! <br /> <br />Regards, and good luck with your project, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          My query is what development has been done or is anticipated in providing a uniform strategy for the use of metadata in the Legal arena. Metadata has the capacity to revolutionise evidentiary content in the courts and hence have a massive impact on one of the fundamental ways in which we arrange our society. Who should I be contacting about engaging this discussion? I work in a top 15 UK London law firm and this question requires urgent attention. The lawyers do not know what to do. Many thanks.

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2006-05-09 19:14:00 by  ASKDCMI Administrator</div>  
	<p>
	Adam: <br /> <br />The short answer is that in fact numerous efforts have been made, but none are comprehensive.  In the US, much of the work has been directed at interaction between lawyers and the courts, in the form of e-filing systems.  See, for example, http://www.legalxml.org/ .  In Europe, a good deal of effort has gone into XML efforts surrounding EU harmonization, particularly in regulatory areas.  Finally, numerous individual providers of judicial opinions and legislation -- including the governmental bodies that create the information in the first place -- have done work in this area.  Probably the best has been done in the area of point-in-time legislative systems, of which the Tasmanian EnAct system was the first.  Another area relatively rich in activity is transcription of court proceedings. <br /> <br />As to why these efforts haven't been comprehensive, I think there are a number of reasons.  One is that the best starting point -- a horizontal, lightweight standard intended to facilitate net-discoverability, interoperability, and aggregation of judicial opinions and other legal documents in much the same way that OAI has facilitated similar efforts in scientific literature -- just hasn't been done yet; there's nobody clearly vested in doing it.  The second is that different jurisdictions -- and different groups within those jurisdictions -- find it difficult to agree on standards, or even come up with a forum in which such a discussion could take place.  Finally, preparation of a comprehensive standard is difficult if not impossible, and extremely expensive to undertake -- it is an effort comparable in size and scope to TEI, for many of the same reasons, and indeed it may be even larger.  Given that lawyers are involved, it will certainly be more contentious -- and that's not a cheap shot, it's a well-founded comment based on experience. <br /> <br />Bottom line is that many different groups of actors are chipping away at various parts of the problem but nobody knows enough -- or has seen enough benefit -- to justify a full-on standardization.  I think we'll be waiting a long time.  One is tempted to believe that such a thing might exist as an internal system at the larger commercial publishers, but I think not -- at least not yet.  If it exists anywhere, it'd be Thomson -- and you can bet they're not talking. <br /> <br />Thomas R. Bruce  <br />Director, Legal Information Institute <br />Cornell Law School

So, we generally suggest that you look around for similar projects to yours who might have developed a vocabulary, or organize and effort within your community. <br /> <br />Regards, and good luck with your project, <br />Diane I.

          We are tying to implement DCMI Metadata and Controlled Vocabularies for a document management initiative using Documentum. However we have encountered a limitation with platform, which is that Documentum does not support XML databases. Hence we are unable to use the recommended RDF/XML and SKOS representations to capture metadata records and controlled vocabularies. <br /><br />We wanted to check if <br />(a) There are any alternate encoding schemes (syntax) that could be used while working with a standard RDBMS. <br />(b) Do any leading content management products (Vignette, Documentum, Interwoven, FileNET) that natively provide support for DCMI metadata. <br /><br />Any feedback/advise would be welcome.

We will need to refine/qualify some of the Dublin Core element types in order to describe our information resources appropriately.  <br /><br />We are not so much concerned with encoding schemes relevant to the Health domain as in the refinements/qualifiers required for description of resources such as source files, facts, dimensions, aggregates, statistical methods, reports, queries, etc.  <br /><br />Do you know if there are other initiatives that are working on refinements/qualifiers for description of datasets, data elements, transformation rules, other 'information objects' required to provide business descriptions of information resources in the data warehouse / business intelligence environment?<br /><br />We would be very interested in communicating with others working to apply Dublin Core standards to the description of data and information resources.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help.<br /><br />Sally McMillan<br /><br />

	Sally: <br /> <br />We're not aware of any specific projects in your area of interest, but one good way to go beyond what we know is to ask your question on the DC-General list, which goes out to hundreds of people interested in Dublin Core and metadata.  You can find information on subscribing to the list and posting questions at: http://dublincore.org/about/contact/#dcgeneral. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Hello,<br />I am part of committee charged with updating the guidelines for use of Dublin Core in the University of Chicago Library's digital projects. We have been discussing the differences between the types, Still Image and Image and have come to no agreement about application, in part because some of the materials listed, maps, paintings, and drawings for example, are noted in both. Yet, Still Image is said to be narrower in scope, yet how much narrower?   <br />A second question, why in the definition of Image are photographic prints limited to those of physical objects and do not extend to those of people? <br /><br />Thank you for any help you can give us,<br />Judith Dartt<br />

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2006-04-24 15:33:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Judith: <br /> <br />Part of the answer to your question lies in the history of the addition of Still Image and Moving Image to the DCMIType vocabulary. In the beginning there was only Image, but a proposal came forward to provide more specificity for image collections, allowing them to categorize materials as "still" or "moving."  In general we recommend that collections choose either the broader term "Image," or the two more granular terms, rather than all three together. It's likely that most image collections will find any of those three inadequate, and will likely use another type list as well.  This is fine, but we do suggest that at least one of the DCMIType terms be used to ensure interoperability. <br /> <br />All of the examples listed in definitions and comments are just that: examples.  They're not meant to limit the definitions in any way. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          I would be grateful if you could tell me if the value of Rights must be a type of right (i.e. intellectual property) or an entity (i.e.Ministry of Education). It may happen that a ministry is the sponsor of a project so it has got all the rights of the outputs of the project (documents, learning objects, newsletters, databases ecc). I don't know whether the name (value)of the entity &quot;Ministry of...&quot; must be written in the metadata (label)&quot;Rights&quot; or not. <br />Another question: Where can I find as many examples as possible, so that I can better understand what kind of values are the best to write?<br />I hope you can understand my English...<br />Looking forward to hearing from you<br />Best regards.<br />Alessandra Cornero

	Alessndra: <br /> <br />The best place to look for guidance information for Dublin Core is "Using Dublin Core" (http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/) which includes specific assistance on each element and refinement recommended by DCMI. <br /> <br />As for your specific question, "Rights" should include a rights statement.  The name of a person or entity holding rights over a resource should to in "Rights Holder."  These are two separate elements--but only "Rights" is available if you're using Simple Dublin Core. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

        <br/>
          Having read through a lot of documentation on dates and date ranges, I am confused as to what constitutes an acceptable encoding of a date range in HTML, in particular with reference to DCTERMS.valid.<br /><br />Firstly, I have seen examples of all four of the following used on various web sites as a scheme for date encoding, both in DCMIPERIODS, and for DCTERMS.date and its refinements.<br /><br />W3CDTF<br />W3C-DTF<br />DCTERMS.w3cDTF<br />DCTERMS.w3c-DTF<br /><br />Please could you clarify which is correct.<br /><br />ISO 8601:2004 allows for using two dates separated by a solidus to specify a range, i.e. 2005-01-01/2005-01-31, but this does not appear to be valid under W3CDTF, so presumably, this is incorrect:<br /><br />meta name=&quot;DCTERMS.valid&quot; scheme=&quot;DCTERMS.w3CDTF&quot; content=&quot;2005-01-01/2005-01-31&quot;<br /><br />Is the scheme attribute mandatory? Or is the following valid, but less useful?<br />meta name=&quot;DCTERMS.valid&quot; content=&quot;2005-01-01/2005-01-31&quot;<br /><br /><br />Assuming that the correct way to specify the encoding of a date is DCTERMS.w3cDTF, is the following a valid content string for a DCMIPERIOD?<br /><br />start=2005-01-01;end=2005-01-31;scheme=DCTERMS.W3CDTF;<br /><br />And finally, is it necessary to prefix the scheme DCMIPERIOD, i.e.<br /><br />scheme=&quot;DCTERMS.DCMIPERIOD&quot;<br /><br />or is scheme=&quot;DCMIPERIOD&quot; equally valid?<br /><br />Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated,<br /><br />Regards,<br />Simon

	Simon: <br /> <br />Date ranges are something of a problem, certainly, but the problem is not limited to HTML encoding. In general we suggest using the DCMI-Period encoding scheme (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period/) for date ranges, since W3CDTF doesn't accommodate ranges. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

          Metadata often is composed of physical measurements or parameters that require units of measure. Does DCMI have any standard way of expressing these? Any lists, say, of acceptable values for feet, meters, etc.? Any way of combining them - feet/second, miles/hour etc.?

	<p>
	Denise: <br /> <br />A few years ago, DCMI spent considerable time and energy attempting to define a core set of administrative metadata, but decided in the end not to recommend a specific set. It seemed pretty clear to us, after the fact, that there were so many needs that went beyond the core set we'd been discussing, that it was of limited value to continue. It was also true that most needs in this area were internal, not designed to require interoperability, that we felt we were attempting to move beyond our area of expertise. <br /> <br />As the world of metadata continues to change, with new methods of content management and content (and metadata) distribution coming along, we continue to feel that it makes more sense for projects to carefully analyze their own needs and do what works for them.  <br /> <br />One strategy you might try, though is to look for projects that seem to be similar to yours, or use the same content management application, and see what they've worked out.  The DCMI project pages (http://dublincore.org/projects/) is a good place to start.  <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann

So what can I do ? Last year for giving training, I simply put in comment these elements (LCSH to TGN), but it' a pity not to prefer controlled values to anything. However, once, it worked very well, so I wrote a whole file with its help for xsi:type values, and now, this file is wrong again ...  Is the problem only with my 2006 updated software ? <br />I can find in the &quot;Guidelines for implementing DC in XML&quot; or in AskDCMI same examples of using, on dates too (&quot;refer to &quot;xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:W3CDTF&quot;&quot; in e.g. the following code:<br />&lt;dc:date xsi:type=&quot;dcterms:W3CDTF&quot;&gt;1999-09-25T14:20+10:00&lt;/dcterms:W3CDTF&gt; ), so it must work !<br /><br />

          In your new mission statement you said &quot;In the future, DCMI aims to more specifically provide services to developers of metadata systems by offering review of Application Profiles, specifications of how a certain application uses Dublin Core metadata, against the principles laid down in the Dublin Core Abstract Model.&quot;  How are you planning to do this?  Will this be a fee based service?  Unless I am missing a market somewhere, what would be the incentive for someone/organization to do this?  As long as they are abiding by guidelines I don't see an advantage to this proposal. Just wondering why I or anyone else would want to go through this if it isn't necessary.<br />

However, we see that there are organisations that would be interested in a more formal approach: (a) vendors that want to get a "seal of approval" for their products or services that they can use in their marketing, (b) organisations that want to build cross-domain or cross-border services and want to have the technical solution evaluated independently by experts under the responsibility of DCMI.

	<p>
	Emily: <br /> <br />In general, the purpose of describing the Format of a resource is to make it easier for machines to interact with it. This is one reason why DCMI recommends the use of the IMT standard vocabulary for the element. An IMT term should allow a user (perhaps with the help of a browser or other tool) to know whether or not they can read or use the resource, without having to know too much about the technical details.  <br /> <br />As you can see, this doesn't usually require detail about the creation of the resource, and "description" insofar as it might imply a lot of text designed for human understanding, is definitely not recommended.  I hope this helps! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane

          The U.S government site at www.webcontent.gov recommends 6 Dublin Core metadata elements for federal Web sites.  One listed is dc.date, but with a qualifier (or refinement?) of 'reviewed'.  See<br />http://www.firstgov.gov/webcontent/managing_content/organizing/metadata.shtml<br /><br />I don't find that qualifier listed in your documentation, and based on a question and answer I found in the archives, this doesn't seem to be a valid qualifier.  <br /><br />My question is whether it is valid, and if it is not, who can tell the feds it's wrong?<br /><br />Thanks.

	David: <br /> <br />You're absolutely correct that the element listed is not part of the recommended Qualified Dublin Core set. Sadly, we often find that a lack of understanding of how to declare local refinements leads to this kind of thing, and makes it difficult to share data created in this manner (it doesn't pass standard validation, for one thing). <br /> <br />I'll take a stab at telling the feds that it's incorrect, and we'll see whether we can make something good happen ... ;-) <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane <br />

        <br/>
          I work with a vocabulary for the Norwegian Red Cross based on the dublin core standard. Email sent to and from the organization is also going to be tagged. There is an ongoing debate here about how to classify &quot;email&quot;, is it a resource type, a application-specific format, or something else?

	<p>
	Joergen: <br /> <br />It seems to me that "email" is really a genre of material, or "resource type" in your context.  If you're developing a resource type vocabulary, at a more granular level than DCMIType, you might find it useful to use it in conjunction with the more general categories of the DCMIType vocabulary.  In other words, use both a general and project-specific vocabulary, so that outside your context the data might still be usable.  <br /> <br />I hope you'll expose your vocabulary to others--this kind of activity is very ripe for re-use across broader contexts. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

They may indeed have a stylesheet to do that from MARCXML, and it might be worthwhile asking them first. They also maintain a page for MARC Records, Systems and Tools (http://www.loc.gov/marc/marcservice.html) which has a listing of specialized tools that might be worth reviewing.  On that page is a contact address as well, so you can ask specific questions.  <br /> <br />If you don't find what you're looking for there, a question to the DC-General list might be worthwhile. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

	<p>
	Teresa: <br /> <br />I think you've become a bit confused about the choices you need to make and how they fit together into a metadata plan for your project.  <br /> <br />First, I assume from your question that you're trying to describe tiff images--this implies that you're talking about still images rather than moving ones. Depending on what these tiff images are depicting, you might want to look at Dublin Core, VRA Core Categories (http://www.vraweb.org/vracore3.htm) [used for art images] or some other metadata schema, perhaps even NewsML (which is what I think you're refering to by IPTC).  A lot depends on the context in which you're working and who you'll need to share your data with--be it libraries, news organizations, or museums. <br /> <br />RDF is a syntax or 'wrapper' around your metadata schema. Dublin Core can be used with different syntaxes (RDF, XML, XHTML and others) and so can many of the others.  Again, your choices will depend on the context you're working in, who you'll be sharing with, and what your local requirements might be. There are no perfect choices in the abstract sense, it all depends on what you're trying to do. <br /> <br />Some places to look:  <br />RDF Primer: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/ <br />DCMI Encoding Guidelines: http://dublincore.org/resources/expressions/ <br />DCMI Training Resources: http://dublincore.org/resources/training/ <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <br />

	Evan: <br /> <br />DC elements are specifically for the purpose of discovery of resources, not necessarily for the management of information about those resources. While the functionality you're looking for is important to any implementation, we've found over time that there's not much of a consensus about what kinds of elements implementors need in the administrative area.  <br /> <br />As you note, even DC needs to track the status of elements, and so we use properties suggested by ISO 11179, the standard for metadata registries.  <br /> <br />Our suggestion to you would be to look for a similar project to yours, either by browsing our Projects pages (see: http://dublincore.org/projects/) , and see whether you can determine what they're using (asking them is sometimes effective!) and how well those elements work.  <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

	Hi Guy,<BR><BR>You have a  "Long document which consist of several pages". I understand this as the "long document consist of several separate files". If my understanding is right I have the following answer:<BR><BR>In Denmark we have an eGovernment standard for electronic reports published at the web. This standard describe how to separate the reports into chapters, which e.g. mean "one chapter one separate file". These chapters are linked toghether by ordinary hyperlink. There is also a title-page (a separate file linked to the chapters). Only this title page (file) is embedded with metadata including dc.title. DC.title then contain the title of the report. It is possible to use dc.Relation.HasPart to mention the file-names for all the chapters in the report. This metadata-element will also be embedded in the title-file.<BR><BR>Questions are welcome<BR><BR>Regards<BR><BR>Palle<BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR>

          According to your descriptions of elements, I noticed you do not have an element for entering a record in the database, only for the creation date of the asset itself. Has this been looked into, or do DCMI users use a specific date modifier that is &quot;close enough?

	Robert: <br /> <br />The date that a record was added to a database seems to be an administrative need, rather than something that would be part of a descriptive element set (what Dublin Core is designed for).  DCMI recognizes that the needs for administrative data cannot really be satisfied by the DC element sets, but though we've tried to come up with a recommendation for administrative elements we've never managed to agree, given the diversity of projects and needs. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane

          Is there a reason for using MARCXML and DUBLIN CORE for one object in a RDF document?<br /><br />I was thinking of doing that for the reason DC is a popular metadataschema for Information Retrieval on the web and USMARC not. On the other hand USMARC gives better support for more specifistic and larger metadata. With using both metadataschemes I end up getting redundancy, what I don't like. So therefore this question.<br /><br />thanks in advance<br />Nico Roosenboom

	Hi Nico,I'm not sure I understand how you plan to use MARCXML (which I understand to be a non-RDF-based XML format ) in an RDF document (other than as an XML Literal? )But, yes, as you suggest, there may be value in making your resource descriptions available in multiple formats to meet the requirements of applications which consume only particular formats, or to take advtantage of the descriptive features of one particular format that are not available in another format.Even within a purely RDF-based application, it may be worth exposing both, sayresource:x rdfs:label "My Resource" .andresource:x dc:title "My Resource" .A general-purpose application which "understands" only the RDF Schema language might make use of the former triple to generate a label in human-readable displays, but not the latter; whereas a DC-based application might ignore the rdfs:label triple, but make use of the dc:title triple.Your decision probably depends on what advance knowledge you have of the applications which will be processing/consuming your metadata.RegardsPete Johnston

          Following up on a similar questions asked by another, I would like to know exactly how DC works when using an in-house database (oracle based). How does indexing a date, for example, work with other databases if I choose the same field name as in DC? I'm not I understand all the intricate details of how choosing DC metadata elements would work with ours. If we have a field that is similar to one of yours, for example, how do you &quot;map&quot; it to one of yours (how do you even know if it's the same definition)? I keep hearing how important it is to standardize, so that asset information can be shared, but I have yet to see a true-to-life example of how it works. Thanks so much.<br />Robert.

	Dear Robert,<BR><BR>Your question is not so much a DC question as it is a question about how databases can become interopero<BR>able.<BR><BR>The crusial item is the semantic of the fields in the data-base. If you want to merge fields from two different <BR>databases the programmer has to specify which fields can be merged. An mergin two databases will normally<BR>only give mening if the semantics of the fields which are merged are the same. <BR><BR>An example:<BR>DatabaseA  with surname_field SURNAME and name_field NAME. DatabaseB with firstname_field FIRSTNAME and <BR>name_field NAME.<BR><BR>You can not meaningfull (semantic) merge e.g. SURNAME and FIRSTNAME fields. You can merge the two NAME<BR>fields IF the semantic definitions are the same. This semantic definitions are made when  you establish the databases - and it is the "owner" of the database who decide these definitions. <BR><BR>Of cource it can be decided to choose a DC definition of a e.g. date_field or a title_field when you establish your <BR>database. This database will then be interoperable (can merge with) other databases which uses the same definitions (semantics)<BR><BR>further questions are welcome<BR><BR>Regards<BR><BR>Palle<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

          Greetings,<br />         I have a question regarding the dc:type element, if i understand correctly, it is not necessary to use the pre-defined controlled vocabulary terms... Am I right?<br /><br />Actually I am implementing dublincore elements in Adobe XMP, and i was wondering if some additional vocabularies could be added, and if so, how and where do i register them??<br /><br />I would like to register the following dc:type vocabularies:<br />- ID3V1 Metadata sound genre vocabulary<br />- Portable application description software Category class (XML_DIZ_INFO/Program_Info/Program_Category_Class)<br />of www.padspec.org.<br /><br />Are these vocabularies appropriate for dc:type? As they describe the genres of the resource depending on the high-level type, no?<br /><br />On another note, I would also like to know if there are official sub-category classes (like above) for Images, Text and MovingImage types?? (From any standard organization, the only thing i have come close to was the IMDB Genre classification)...<br /><br />Finally, is there a way in RDF to specify the exact classification used? Would it be possible to use an URN to identify these types of vocabularies??<br /><br />Any clarification or help would be greatly appreciated.<br />Thanks, Carl<br />

	<p>
	Carl: <br /> <br />You are correct that use of DCMIType is not required, however, it is recommended that they be used, even if you use additional, more domain-specific or granular vocabularies as well.  In this way, your data can be more easily re-purposed by others. <br /> <br />We'd certainly applaud your efforts to add other vocabularies to your implementation, but it's not now possible to register them.  The best alternative might be to take a look at the work being done with Application Profiles (see the tutorials on the DCMI Webpage under RESOURCES-->TRAINING for some information to get you started).  Documenting your usage of a vocabulary in this way is a good step towards registration.  At one time DCMI had hoped to register vocabularies for implementers in this way, but unfortunately a lack of resources forced the abandonment of that plan.  Other registry projects are likely to assist in this effort within the next few years, but none are yet available for actual registration. <br /> <br />I'm not familiar with the vocabularies you propose to use, but so long as they reflect genre and not technical format they should be appropriate.  Again, if you use DCMIType as well, you make your data more interoperable with other data.  In answer to your question about other sub-vocabularies, there are none specifically recommended by DCMI, but I know that some projects are using them, though sadly it's not always easy to figure out who's doing what in the absence of a distributed registry infrastructure.  You might ask on DC-General, and see if anyone can suggest something. <br /> <br />As for your last question concerning RDF--there is a proposed recommendation for Qualified DC in RDF/XML (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml/) but progress on moving it to recommended status was halted due to the untimely death of one of the authors.  I think caution should be exercised in using the proposed recommendation, as there have been some changes in thinking since it was drafted. Given that, I'd suggest that you ask your RDF question on the DC-Architecture list (see the SUBSCRIBE page at: http://dublincore.org/about/contact/#dcgeneral for information on all the DC mailing lists).  Most of the people conversant with current RDF thinking hang out on that list, and although you may not find a consensus there, you may find enough of one to help you make a decision on moving forward. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I am working in a project to join several educational resources  Web sites. The purpose is to share metadata of those educational resources using DC fields.<br />Several Web sites use the element &quot;Publisher&quot; for the name of the Web site, that makes the resources available in the Web.<br />In the argentine  Web site we have books and journal articles that have an institutional or commercial publishers (for example an University).<br />&#191;Is it correct the use of DC &quot;Publisher&quot; to indicate both the institutional publisher and the Web site? (in a repetible way)<br />Thank you very much for your cooperation<br />Ana Sanllorenti<br />

	Ana: <br /> <br />It is certainly perfectly okay to use Publisher in both those ways in your metadata, and your solution provides a simple way to manage access to both kinds of publishers with slightly different roles in making the resource available. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

	Roger,<BR><BR>It might be helpful to remember that RDF/XML is a representation of an RDF graph. An RDF graph is made up of nodes and predicate or property arcs linking the nodes. When the RDF graph is represented in RDF/XML, the outermost XML element (other than the rdf:RDF element) represents a node in the graph, and the child XML elements each represent predicate/property arcs. And child elements of those XML elements represent nodes, and so on throughout the XML tree. This alternation of node element/property element  is sometimes referred to as "striping". (There are some syntactic features of RDF/XML which can alter the "striping" but I won't bother about them here)<BR><BR>So looking at your example:<BR><BR>- your outermost rdf:Description element represents a node (with the URI <!--StartFragment --> <A href="http://mydoc.doc">http://mydoc.doc</A>)<BR>- your dc:date element represents a property arc with the URI http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date<BR>- your next rdf:Description element represents a blank node<BR>- your <!--StartFragment -->dct:DateScheme element represents a property arc with the URI <A href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/DateScheme">http://purl.org/dc/terms/DateScheme</A> (N.B. DCMI does not define a property with this URI; there is a class with this URI)<BR>- your <!--StartFragment -->dct:W3CDTF element represents a property arc with the URI <A href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/W3CDTF">http://purl.org/dc/terms/W3CDTF</A> (Again. DCMI does not define a property with this URI; there is a class with this URI)<BR>- your rdf:value element is treated as a "typed node element" i.e. it represents a node and an rdf:type predicate. The parse doesn't expect a node element to have literal content, so it complains about the content "<!--StartFragment -->2005-12-30". <BR><BR>First, I think you intend the rdf:value element to represent a property not a node. Second, I'm not quite sure what your intent is with the use of dct:DateScheme, but I think you want to define a subproperty of the dc:date property to represent a "date of future review"?<BR><BR>So essentially I think you need something like the RDF/XML below, with your:dateOfFutureReview defined as a subpropert of the dc:date property. Sometimes the AskDCMI system seems to scramble XML documents, so just in case this is eligible, I've put a temporary copy at<BR><BR><A href="http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lispj/temp/askdcmi/reviewdate.rdf">http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lispj/temp/askdcmi/reviewdate.rdf</A><BR><BR>Regards<BR><BR>Pete Johnston<BR>

	Joanne: <br /> <br />The list of currently recommended schemes is at: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#H4  At one time, DCMI was planning to "register" more schemes, but after some extensive discussion, determined that it could not muster sufficient support to manage such a registry. This means that the list you see at the URL above is unlikely to grow very much, and will not be sufficient for implementers.  There is some renewed insterest lately around registry applications and functionality, so it's likely that this sorry situation will improve within the next year or so.

          I'm wondering: if an HTML page includes an image in its presentation using an &lt;img&gt; tag, which DCMI term best expresses that relationship?<br /><br />hasPart/isPartOf? references/isReferencedBy? requires?

          Hello and good afternoon,<br />I wanted to know what exactly are DC meta tags and why are they used on some websites and not on others? what purpose do they serve search engines and visitors? Do they serve any purpose at all? Your website dublincore.org was difficult for me to navigate to find these answers. Can you please help me with the answers to these questions, or know who on the Internet can help me answer these questions? Thank you.

	Wendy: <br /> <br />Dublin Core is a standard for describing resources, and not always used in the context of "meta tags" (which are associated with HTML or XHTML expressions). Like all standards, it has not been adopted across the board--only where it has been deemed useful.  What purpose the metadata description serves really depends entirely on the context and goals of the project that uses it, so there's no "one size fits all" answer to your questions. <br /> <br />You might consider taking a look at "Using Dublin Core" (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/) which has some introductory material about how DC is used.  Also, our Projects pages (see: http://dublincore.org/projects/) might be helpful to illustrate how DC has been used in a variety of implementations. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

          Has anyone considered how to cryptographically bind metadata to the source document.  Has anyone considered possible structures within the metadata to deal with the cryptographic data that binds.  For instance, if a digital signatures are used to bind, what structure might be used within the meta for these signatures.

See: <br /> <br />DCMI Box (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-box/) <br />DCMI Point (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point/) <br /> <br />Our current recommendation is based on our DC Abstract Model (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/) and stems from the notion that geographic data is most properly part of a separate "package" of information that is linked to descriptive metadata via a number of possible ways. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

          I noticed that the language element has the xml:lang attribute assigned. Is the intention to place a lnaguage code into the 'language' attribute, or to place a textual name in the language specified by xml:lang?<br /><br />Also do you recommend a suitable sub list of supported languages or can all of the 3 character language codes be used?

	<p>
	Christopher: <br /> <br />The DC:language element and the xml:lang attribute are talking about two different things.  The Language element describes the language of the described resource; the xml:lang attribute describes the language of the statement.  An xml:lang attribute might be used, for instance, to differentiate between parallel titles or translated titles, or subject headings in different languages.  In this way, the descriptive metadata can be used more specifically by a service to meet user needs. <br /> <br />There are two available language encoding schemes recommended by DCMI: ISO639-2 (http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html) and RFC3066 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt).  The RFC is probably the most flexible option, but you should take a look at both before determining which meets your requirements. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I have found at the FIATECH Data Standards Clearinghouse a document providing characteristics to compare different interoperability systems. I couldn't find an answer on the DCM website for all the characteristics mentioned. These are:<br /><br />1- The cost per one interface; a general indication of the typical cost to build one software-mapping interface.<br /><br />2- Focus: Usage-driven vs. Comperhensive; usage-driven approaches are only for information that organizations agree should be exchanged. A comprehensive approach tries to define a standard that is completely open and flexible to any data exchange.  <br /><br />3- Scope; multiple or single-domain.<br /><br />4- Extensibility; extensible vs. fixed: extensible allows for two parties to extend the standard without having to go through the full standardization process. A fixed solution would force people to build separate special purpose interfaces.<br /><br />5- Model content; focused (detailed descriprion of data), broad (generalized frameworks that provide some high level data description) or mixed.<br /><br />6- Usage; exchange or repository sharing<br /><br />7- Exchange file content; data model + data (both contained in the exchanged file) vs. data-only (contained in the exchanged file)  <br /><br />8- Data model approach; abstract-domain vs. partitioned domain: the abstract domain adresses the need to support multiple subject domains, whereas the partitioned domain approach can accomodate by partitioning the multiple domains into some domains, which are general purpose and reusable and others of which are very subject specific.<br /><br />Could-you please let me know where the DCM stands within these characterisitics?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Nada.

	Nada: <br /> <br />I'll do my best with these criteria, but with the caveat that I'm not sure what an "interoperability system" is in this context, so some of these may not apply very well to Dublin Core. <br /> <br />"1- The cost per one interface; a general indication of the typical cost to build one software-mapping interface." <br /> <br />I don't think this really applies, since DC is not an application. <br /> <br />"2- Focus: Usage-driven vs. Comperhensive; usage-driven approaches are only for information that organizations agree should be exchanged. A comprehensive approach tries to define a standard that is completely open and flexible to any data exchange." <br /> <br />Dublin Core has been created by consensus, and though intended to be "core" and not "comprehensive" applies fairly well across domains. It is, by the way, already a standard: ISO Standard 15836-2003 (February 2003) and NISO Standard Z39.85-2001 (September 2001). <br /> <br />"3- Scope; multiple or single-domain." <br /> <br />Dublin Core is definitely used in multiple domains: for confirmation take a look at our project pages: http://dublincore.org/projects/ <br /> <br />"4- Extensibility; extensible vs. fixed: extensible allows for two parties to extend the standard without having to go through the full standardization process. A fixed solution would force people to build separate special purpose interfaces." <br /> <br />DC has always been extensible, and the DC community is working closely with others to define appropriate methods to define Application Profiles to allow re-use of properties from a number of schemas. The DC Training pages (http://dublincore.org/resources/training/) include tutorials on Application Profiles you might find useful. <br /> <br />"5- Model content; focused (detailed description of data), broad (generalized frameworks that provide some high level data description) or mixed." <br /> <br />The Dublin Core Abstract Model is described here: http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/ <br /> <br />"6- Usage; exchange or repository sharing" <br /> <br />Simple Dublin Core is the minimum standard used in the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, and Qualified Dublin Core (a richer extension) is used as a base format by a number of important metadata aggregators. <br /> <br />"7- Exchange file content; data model + data (both contained in the exchanged file) vs. data-only (contained in the exchanged file)"   <br /> <br />Normally data only. <br /> <br />"8- Data model approach; abstract-domain vs. partitioned domain: the abstract domain adresses the need to support multiple subject domains, whereas the partitioned domain approach can accomodate by partitioning the multiple domains into some domains, which are general purpose and reusable and others of which are very subject specific." <br /> <br />I'm not sure this applies, but you'll need to make your own determination on this one based on the information I've provided. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I'd like a suggestion on the best content of DC.title for parts of a Web-based publication. Assume I have a Web publication called &quot;My Project&quot;, whose HTML home page has the tag '&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.title&quot; content=&quot;My Project&quot;/&gt;'. The publication has parts as separate Web pages with titles like &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Acknowledgments&quot;, &quot;Contents&quot;, etc. Each component page has a tag like '&lt;link rel=&quot;DCTERMS.isPartOf&quot; href=&quot;http://myserver.school.edu/MyProject.html&quot;/&gt;, relating it to the home page. What's the best way to handle their title element? Just '&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.title&quot; content=&quot;Introduction&quot;/&gt;' and so on, or something like '&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.title&quot; content=&quot;Introduction (to My Project)&quot;/&gt;' to be more self-explanatory?

	David: <br /> <br />My inclination for titles with little semantic content (like "Introduction," "Contents," etc.) would be to suggest that you use them as subtitles. As an example: <br /> <br />My Project: Introduction <br />My Project: Contents <br /> <br />This strategy might also relieve you of the necessity for making "isPartOf" links, which can get pretty difficult to maintain over time. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

	Derron: <br /> <br />I'm not sure there is "a" standard for documenting encoding schemes (by this I'm assuming that you mean controlled vocabularies, not syntax encoding schemes). Some very useful work is going on in the Knowledge Organization community with the SKOS work (see: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/), which is the basis for new efforts to design registries for controlled vocabularies. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

          Dear Sir or Madam:<br /><br />My name is Claudia Labahn and I am currently interning at Thieme Medical Publishers in New York. <br />My supervisor Ms Anne-Kathrin Hayek, Project Manager Electronic Books, asked me to research on Dublin Core and if the tools &amp; software are helpful for our products. We are especially interested to use products of Dublic Core for our electronic products. <br /><br />I checked the Dublin Core website for further information but I still have some questions regarding the following topics:<br />1. For whom is the Dublin Core a standard? (publishers, libraries, etc.)<br />2. Who uses tools &amp; software of Dublin Core?<br />3. For whom are the Metadata standards developed?<br /><br />If you have any questions regarding this email please do not hesitate to contact me at any time.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

	Claudia: <br /> <br />Dublin Core is not a standard limited by domain. It is usable by anyone who needs a simple, well-documented standard for resource description. It's being used widely in a number of areas, including libraries and publishers. It's probably the most widely used metadata standard in use today, particularly internationally. A good way to figure out the range of use is to take a look at our projects pages: http://dublincore.org/projects/. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          We are just working on a pilot project implementing a Content Management System on the postgraduate recruitment section of the university web site. We are using some of the Dublin Core elements and need to include the names of the academic departments involved in running each course and producing the description which is displayed on the web site. <br /><br />We have decided that the Creator element is the best one to use, but where multiple departments are involved, should we have separate Creator entries for each, or can multiple departments be listed in one? <br /><br />Also, should be be using the full form of name for each one or can we leave out &quot;Department&quot; and &quot;School&quot; (we have departments within schools) eg the proper form of name is: &quot;School of Agriculture, Policy and Development. Department of Agricultural and Food Economics&quot; or can we use this shortened version &quot;Agriculture Policy and Development. Agricultural and Food Economics&quot; The cataloguer in me wants to do the former (ie use the proper form of name) but the project manager argues that users won't search for &quot;school&quot; or &quot;department&quot; so we don't need to include those words. Any guidance about how strict we should be on this is very gratefully received!

	Jackie: <br /> <br />The role that you describe for your departments seems appropriate for either Creator or Contributor, although I must admit a continuing bias towards using Contributor for corporate bodies.  Best practice for multiples is to have separate iterations, rather than lumping them together.  This is particularly important for corporate bodies where there's hierarchical considerations (as you point out) and punctuation doesn't work very well to separate them.  <br /> <br />Eventually you're going to need to manage these corporate names in some way to make your information display well as your information scales up. I'd suggest that you either adopt AACR2 conventions for constructing those names or use the entire hierarchy.  <br /> <br />As for searching, you need to point out to your project manager that the data will likely last lots longer than your search application (and is much more expensive to create and maintain), which argues that the search application conform to the data, not the other way around. A big rule for me has always been: DON'T MANIPULATE YOUR DATA TO MAKE UP FOR INADEQUACIES OF YOUR SYSTEM (Shouting intentional!). <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

          Is there a property/key to indicate the level of cataloging? For instance, the thesis is submitted and accepted, but the catalogers have not completely described the work (however, it is searchable and accessible to the users). We would like to add an element where we would mention that the work has not yet been completely cataloged. Is there a recommendation for this?<br />Thank you very much.

	Ana: <br /> <br />The status information you're describing falls primarily under the rubric of 'administrative metadata'--something that Dublin Core does not handle. We've found over time that most projects must be quite specific in how they handle things like status and level of description. <br /> <br />Our recommendation would be that you look at similar projects (the DCMI Projects pages are often good for this, http://dublincore.org/projects/) and see what they do, and whether they're happy with their decisions! <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

If you go to the DCMI Registry (http://dublincore.org/dcregistry/) and click on "Browse | Search" and look at the language preference list (there's a link just below the blue header).  Check out the representation of elements in the languages you need to accommodate, browse some terms, and you'll see that the Label, Definition and Description are in the selected language, and you can look at various representations of the translation. <br /> <br />I hope this helps you move towards a multilingual application that suits your needs. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          Hi there,<br /><br />I am considering annotating a collection of digital photos with DC.  If I encode the DC using RDF, and use the dumddown algorithm as described at http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml/#sec3, how compatible will this be with existing DC/RDF parsers?  That is, will all/most/some/none DC/RDF parser be able to read this?<br /><br />Is this algorithm something that people have generally accepted, and moving forward will be much more common?  Thanks.<br />

	Roger: <br /> <br />The document you cite, with the dumb down algorithm, is a DCMI recommendation, which means that it has been vetted through the Dublin Core Community, and reflects the best consensus about how to do things properly.  That said, there's no guarantee that *every* RDF parser that professes to know DC will be in compliance with these recommendations. As you know, this world is fairly unregulated, and some people tend to go off into the bushes! <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <br/>
          Dear all,<br /><br />I am currently implementing application schemas to represent data, and the data about that data (the metadata). This is where the Dublin Core metadata comes in, in describing that data. I would like to make use of the terms you describe, as well as defining some additional terms which come from the IEEE LOM, and then ensure that all XML files conform to both the Dublin core metadata schema and the IEE LOM. How would I go about this? <br /><br />I've tried downloading the simple DC XML schema for use in my application, but using XMLSpy, when writing a sample XML file out from it, I have to choose a root element from one of the 15 terms of the DC metadata schema, but I want the root element to be something more decriptive like 'metadata' and then followed by the dublin core terms.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Paul Kiddie
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-07-27 14:15:00 by  Pete Johnston</div>  
	<p>
	<br />Paul,<br /><br /><br />Taking your last point first and working backwards ;-), the current DCMI-recommended XML binding for DC metadata [1] does not mandate any particular root/container XML element. It is left to the implementer to provide a container element. The reason for this is that different implementers may choose to apply different constraints to the content model of that container element, in order to reflect the particular DC "application profile" for which they are providing a binding. The document at [2] provides some examples of how you might do this.<br /><br />The question of using DC and LOM metadata terms in combination is rather more complex. When you say you wish to "ensure that all XML files conform to both the Dublin core metadata schema and the IEE LOM", do you mean that you wish to create a single XML document that can be interpreted as both a LOM-XML document (conforming to the LOM XML binding) and a DC-XML document (conforming to the DC XML binding)?<br /><br />If so, I don't think that is possible. <br /><br />You _may_ be able to construct a document that is syntactically valid in terms of the XML schemas provide for LOM and for DC. The LOM XML binding (I think?) requires a fixed name for the root XML element (lom:lom); as the DC XML binding permits any name for the root/container XML element, in theory you could use lom:lom as he name of the container element. <br /><br />So far so good.<br /><br />However, it is critical to remember that in each case the XML format is simply a binding for an information structure which is constructed according to the "abstract model" associated with the individual metadata standard. i.e. the XML document is interpreted in accordance with the rules of the binding to generate a data structure described by the "abstract model" associated with the individual metadata standard.<br /><br />For DC, that abstract model is described in [3]. A DC application interprets an XML document conforming to the DC XML binding in terms of that binding and maps components within the XML document to constructs within the DCMI Abstract Model: each child XML element within the container element is interpreted as representing a statement about a resource; the XML QName which is the XML element name is mapped to a URI, and that URI is interpreted as the URI of a property; the XML element content is interpreted as a value string; the XML QName that appears as the value of the xsi:type attribute is mapped to a URI, and that URI is interpreted as the URI of an encoding scheme; and so on.<br /><br />For LOM, the abstract model is not explicitly described, but the LOM standard describes a LOM instance as a hierarchical/tree structure of "LOM data elements" where one element is nested within another. "Leaf" elements are associated with specific datatypes which determine how their values are to be interpreted. A LOM application interprets an XML document conforming to the LOM XML binding in terms of that binding: again, it maps components within the XML document to constructs within the LOM hierachical/tree structure. Because an XML document is also a representation of a hierarchical data structure, that mapping is fairly straightforward - but it is important to remember that the components within a LOM-XML document are different things from the data elements within a LOM instance.<br /><br />So, let's go back to our XML document with lom:lom as root/container element. Consider the child XML elements of this root element: for a DC application, they represent statements; for a LOM application they represent LOM category data elements. A DC application interprets the content of the child XML element as a value string; a LOM application expects further child XML elements and interprets the in terms of the tree structure described by the LOM standard.<br /><br />The examples in 6.1 and 6.2 of [1] are misleading in this respect: they may be syntactically valid but at least some parts of that document have no interpretation defined by the DC XML binding.<br /><br />The difficulty arises because the two abstract models used by DC and by LOM are quite different: they include _different_ types of construct (in the DC abstract model all terms are identified/referenced using URIs and there is no notion of element containment/nesting; and in the LOM abstract model there is no notion of properties and statements and no notion that terms are identified by URIs). The types of term used in each are different (LOM data elements are containers within a hierarchical structure, and the interpretation of that structure is defined by the LOM standard; DC "elements" are properties which are referenced in statements which described relationships between resources). Terms which are usable in one model are not meaningful in the other.<br /><br />So, in short, LOM data elements can not be used in DC metadata descriptions, and vice versa. Rather it is necessary to analyse the information which is being conveyed by a construct within one standard, and to create the appropriate components which _can_ be used to represent that information within the other standard. <br /><br />For the case of the LOM, this process is made more complex by the fact that the interpretation of a LOM data element is determined by its context within the LOM tree data structure: it is not possible to say simply that, say, all LOM "leaf" data elements are equivalent to properties. Rather it is necessary to examine each part of the LOM instance in turn, analyse its interpretation in terms of the LOM abstract model and the LOM standard, and identify what components are required to express that information in terms of the DC abstract model, i.e. what properties, vocabulary/syntax encoding schemes are required to express the information represented by LOM data elements, LOM datatypes etc.<br /><br />Mikael Nilsson provides an excellent account of this work for mapping between the LOM and the RDF data model at [4]. He notes the complexity of the process, and the fact that it has to be done by considering each LOM data element individually. Because the DC abstract model is compatible with the RDF data model, the terms used within the LOM RDF binding [5] are usable within DC metadata descriptions (and indeed the LOM RDF binding makes use of terms from DCMI vocabularies).<br /><br />So, for example, the property URIs<br /><br />http://ltsc.ieee.org/2002/09/lom-general#structure<br />http://ltsc.ieee.org/2002/09/lom-general#aggregationLevel<br /><br />can be used in statements in DC metadata descriptions. To use them in the DC XML binding it would be necessary to construct suitable XML schemas, so that those URIs can be represented as the QNames of XML elements.<br /><br />Some work is planned to build on the LOM RDF binding to develop a mapping from LOM to the DC abstract model, and hopefully this will make it clearer how to address the sort of issues which I think you are seeking to address.<br /><br />Pete Johnston<br /><br />[1] http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/<br />[2] http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/notes/<br />[3] http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/<br />[4] http://kmr.nada.kth.se/papers/SemanticWeb/LOMRDFBinding-ARIADNE.pdf<br />[5] http://kmr.nada.kth.se/el/ims/metadata.html

        <br/>
          Can I declare a new element in an application profile?  Or, must I first declare the new element in my local element set and then reference it in the application profile?  <br /><br />In my records management application profile, I am going to reference DC elements but since the application profile deals with records management, I also have to include records management elements (that obviously DC does not address, e.g. retention period, disposition authority, etc).  Do the latter elements have to be declared first in my local 'records management element set' before they can be included in the application profile?  Or can I create them within the application profile itself?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Denise

	Denise,As you suggest, an application profile "references" terms rather than "declaring" them, so you should "declare" your application-specific terms before referencing them in your application profile. At a minimum your term declaration should be a human-readable document which specifies- the URI for the term- the "type" of the term, as defined by the DCMI Abstract Model [1] (property, vocabulary encoding scheme/class, syntax encoding scheme/datatype ) - a definition for the term- any relationships to existing terms (e.g. refinement/subproperty relationships )You may also wish to consider providing a machine-processable version of that declaration using the RDF Vocabulary Definition Language (RDF Schema ).RegardsPete Johnston [1] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model</a>/

          Abstract<br />Can an abstract be taken from the text of a web site word for word?  What do you mean that an abstract can only be formal?

	Kathy: <br /> <br />It is true that the refinement Abstract was intended to be used when Description was not sufficient.  The proposers of the refinement felt that there was a substantive difference between an Description (regardless of source) and a abstract created according to formal standards. This was particularly a concern for those describing scholarly papers for which an abstract was an important part of a submission. <br /> <br />That said, if the distinction isn't important in your context it might be best to stick with Description. I've often taken a description from the text of a web site, and recommend that strategy often.  <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <br/>
          Hi, you use Document Status within your own documents, as I would like to with in mine.  We manage many iterations of a specific document and may also have a number of published versions on record, including their respective interim versions.<br /><br />I do not see a Term or Term Refinement that covers the state of a document.  In my case I would expect the value to be a title, version, state (ie awaiting approval etc) value.<br /><br />Is there a term that specifically (as opposed to ambiguously) supports document state?  <br /><br />What would you recommend?
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-08-17 13:06:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Alexander: <br /> <br />You are correct that Dublin Core maintains a status for all its documents.  However, we consider the status an administrative function, not a descriptive one. If you click on the metadata link at the bottom of the first page of "Using Dublin Core" (see: http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/) you'll note that the link goes only to the current version, and not to the dated versions.  <br /> <br />We could, if we wished, reflect those links in our metadata (though the maintenance would be more onerous). Note that in the Relation element, there are refinements for IsVersionOf and HasVersion, which can be used to link between versions if desired.  <br /> <br />It's certainly true that you want to keep track of the status of documents, but using an element or refinement to do so is not necessarily the best way to do that.  If you're using a database to manage your documents, you'll likely be storing much of the administrative information there, and working out a method for managing status within that context is probably your best bet. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane Hillmann <br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"

        <br/>
          I would like to ask something that sounds very obvious but which still niggles at me a bit.<br /> <br />If I change one word in the DC term definitions (element and refinements), have I then created local terms?  In each of the definitions, for my particular local application, I would like to change the word &quot;resource&quot; to &quot;record&quot;.<br /> <br />E.g.  The DC definition for Description is &quot;An account of the content of the resource.&quot;  The definition I would like to use is: &quot;An account of the content of the record.&quot;<br /> <br />Similarly, with all of the other definitons.<br /> <br />Once I change that one word am I now creating a local term? Hence can I no longer identify it as dc.description and instead now have to call it my.description?  In the best of all worlds I would like to have each of my terms stand as their own elements rather than as refinements of DC elements.<br /> <br />Thanks for your help.<br /> <br />Regards,<br /> <br />Denise<br />

        <br/>
          Hi there,<br /><br />I am considering annotating a collection of digital photos with DC.  I was just wondering why the encoding schemes are defined as RDF classes and not RDF properties.  Is it to make them more closely correspond to RDF collections?  Thanks.<br />

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-06-29 04:04:00 by  Pete Johnston</div>  
	<p>
	Hi Roger,I'm not sure that the correspondence with RDF collections was a consideration. Rather, I think it was the notion that a reference to an encoding scheme indicates the "type" of the value that made it seem appropriate to model them as classes. So e.g. in the case of a resource being associated with an LCSH subject heading, the relationship between resource and LCSH heading is one of (resource ) "has-as-subject" (value ), and the value is an instance of the class of LCSH headings.RegardsPete Johnston

	I don't know of any expression of Dublin Core in OWL, but that certainly doesn't mean that no one has been working in this area.  I would suggest that you ask the question on the DC-General list, since most implementors are members of the list, and likely to be networked with others.  If no one has yet attempted the work, you might consider doing it yourself and asking for help or review from those who might be interested in participating.   <br /> <br />Good luck in your quest, and please let us know if there's any work we should highlight as you proceed. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

          Hello,<br /><br />What element/refinement must be used to describe the cretor's &quot;affiliation&quot; (this is the French word, I don't know it in English), i.e, the entity the creator works in (laboratory and team, research institution, or other), which has the intellectual and administrative responsability of the intellectual content over the creator. <br />I think element 'publisher' is good for who edite physiscally the resource ('The entity responsible for making the resource available'), but I wonder for this 'affiliation' purpose in my working environment: we edit numeric journal from paper journal, then we are publishers, we think the previous paper editor is publisher too, but what about the creator's working organism?

	There is a lot of information about Dublin Core on the DCMI website, located at:<a href="http://dublincore.org" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org</A>/. Information about the element set in particular can be found at: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dces</A>/. You might also find it helpful to look at the conceptual model which underlies the element set. This is available on the DCMI website at: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model</a>/. Other sources of information external to DCMI itself can be found by doing a google search on "dublin core element set" or some variation of this term. The online journal, D-Lib (<a href="http://dublincore.org" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org</A>/ ) also contains a number of articles about the DC element set which you might find helpful.

	Russell,The DCMI recommendations for encoding DC metadata in X/HTML do not adopt that convention, so an application written to support the DCMI recommendation would not extract DC metadata from the "a" X/HTML element.Having said that, it seems to me your construct is consistent with the semantics of the X/HTML "a" element and the "rel" attribute, so in theory you could define your own X/HTML profile to indicate that you were encoding DC metadata in this way?One point to note is that you would need to clarify what the subject of that statement is.For info, the development work on XHTML 2.0 has led to a proposal for an attribute-based syntax for RDF:<a href="http://www.formsplayer.com/notes/rdf-a.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.formsplayer.com/notes/rdf-a.html</A>which (see section 6 ) would support almost exactly the construct you describe - the only difference being that (I think ) in RDF/A the value of the rel attribute is a URI or XML QName. Note also the point there that "The statements are not, however, about the document -- the two anchors in this example will generate two unique [anonymous node]s"N.B. As far as I know, RDF/A is still currently work-in-progress, but if it is integrated into XHTML 2.0, I imagine DCMI would amend the DC-in-XHTML recommendation in some way to reflect that.RegardsPete Johnston

	Ale: <br /> <br />These are good questions, but I'm afraid that there are no hard and fast answers. As you have noted, Dublin Core doesn't have a clear way to separate and describe subtitles. Some projects come up with internal rules about what to do with "important" subtitles, others do the simple thing and keep them with the main title, using a colon to separate. <br /> <br />In one sense, the most important thing is consistency--with consistent data, an application that wants to separate subtitles from main titles can do so, using the punctuation to parse the subtitle, whether or not you do the work up front.  <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I am the editor of the following web based academic journal:<br /><br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk<br /><br />I am just starting to implement the Dublin Core Set into the journal. But I am new to this and would like some advice/checks, if possible from someone with more experience and knowledge than me.<br /><br />1. I have incorporated DCM into the following pages:<br /><br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Iles.html<br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Cardwell.html<br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Tanji.html<br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk/contents/authorindex.html<br />www.japanesestudies.org.uk/contents/reviews2005.html<br /><br />Please would someone take a quick look at the data and see if it is OK? Also, do you have any specific advice for improvements or additions to the data for this kind of resource?<br /><br />Also, do you think I should add any more data strings? Abstracts etc. may be one.<br /><br />Thank you so much for your help. I am very new to this and teaching myself as I go along ... and really appreciate therefore any help that someone can give me.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br /><br />Peter

	Peter:<br /><br />I took a look at your first example:<br /><br />http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Iles.html<br /><br />and you've made a good start!  I have the following suggestions:<br /><br />1. You have the author listed as Creator and Contributor, and in the Subject area.  If he is indeed the author only, it's best to choose either Creator or Contributor for your authors and include the name once. You might want to put the first author in Creator and all subsequent in Contributor, but whatever you do, choose something and be consistent.<br /><br />2. If you're using the DCMIType vocabulary in Type (as is recommended), you need to use the term "Text" in this instance, not repeat "text/html" as you also have included (correctly) in Format.<br /><br />3. In Identifier, you should reference the resource you're describing, which is represented by the URL: http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/reviews/2005/Iles.html  The ISSN and title you include is for the journal itself, which is a separate resource.  You might more properly include the journal title and ISSN in an IsPartOf refinement if you wish. This would be expressed as: <meta name="DCTERMS.isPartOf" content="Electronic journal of contemporary japanese studies - ISSN 1476-9158" /><br /><br />4. Because this is a review of another work, you might wish to make standard reference to the other work, in addition to (or instead of) the inclusion of the work in the Description.  This could look like: <meta name="DCTERMS.references" content="Nornes, Abé Mark (2001), Japanese Documentary Film: The Meiji Era through Hiroshima, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press" /><br /><br />5. If you haven't already reviewed "Expressing Dublin Core in HTML/XHTML meta and link elements (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/) you should surely do so!<br /><br />6. Including an abstract or a first paragraph into your description might well serve as a good indication to users of the subject and scope of the resource.  Particularly if others capture your metadata and re-use it, that extra effort might pay off!<br /><br />Good luck with your project.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane

          Your internet address was provided by the National Science Foundation as a source for sustaining materials posted on the WEB.  My question is -how do I register with your initiative to store information I will generate potentially from an NSF grant proposal.  Their instructions are for me to have a sustainability plan for tagging these products with specific metadata to ensure that they can be indexed and cataloged with the National Science Digital library (www.nsdl.org).  My question is - could you please provide me with instructions for such a plan or direct me to another location where I can fin out this information.  Thank you

          I'm writing an article for a document management course, about metadata and Dublin Core especially.

	Johan:Dublin Core is celebrating its Tenth Anniversary this year, and I'm not sure any of us could have predicted a decade ago what we'd be experiencing now. So, anything I might say in answer to your very interesting question has to be regarded as crystal ball gazing, and I'm not so sure about the crystal ball!That said, I would predict that we would see additional development of domain specific standards for metadata expression, using as a basis a number of extant formats. We will also see new formats (though, perhaps some of that has slowed? ) Dublin Core is likely to continue to be a "lingua franca" mediating meaning amongst those developments, and possibly leading the way in filling in the missing infrastructure pieces to assist in the development of the Semantic Web. Please check with me in another decade and see how good my crystal ball is behaving!Regards,Diane

        <br/>
          If another metadata scheme, such as e-GMS &quot;extends&quot; a DCMI term, is that extension only valid within that scheme, or can it be somehow attributed to DCMI. For example...<br /><br />e-GMS defines the element 'date' and maps it to the term 'date' in DC. Therefore full terms 'DC.date' and 'eGMS.date' are equivalent.<br /><br />e-GMS defines the qualifier 'available' for 'date' and again maps it to the qualifier 'available' in DC. Therefore full terms 'DC.date.available' and 'eGMS.date.available' are equivalent.<br /><br />e-GMS also defines the qualifier 'declared' for 'date' but there is no equivalent term in DC. Therefore whilst the full term 'eGMS.date.declared' would be valid, the term 'DC.date.declared' would not be. Or at least that is my opinion!<br /><br />I would be grateful for confirmation or otherwise of this view.<br /><br />Many Thanks<br /><br />Andy<br />

	Andy:e-GMS is essentially an Application Profile, developed for a particular purpose at a time when the concept was a new one. In general, as we've gotten more comfortable with APs, it's become clearer where it's "safe" to use extensions and where it creates problems.In the example you give, where the e-GMS element "date" maps explicitly in the e-GMS specification to the DC element "date" you're very safe in calling those equivalent properties. And again, when refinements like "Available" are defined the same and equivalence assertions are made, you're on safe territory.You're absolutely correct in stating that where there is no equivalence asserted, there is no way to "extend" that term into DC. Thanks for your question!Regards,Diane

        <br/>
          If I have a webpage listing, for example, the publications available for the Planning Sections of a County Council website, what is the best way to make the list of documents searchable. (Site will be using Verity Ultraseek). In this example, on the current webpage there are 2 PDF documents to download. Meath County Development Plan, and Navan Town Development Plan. Should I use:<br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Subject&quot; content=&quot;List of Meath County Council Planning Publications&quot; /&gt;<br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Subject&quot; content=&quot;Meath County Development Plan&quot; /&gt;<br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.Subject&quot; content=&quot;Navan Town Development Plan&quot; /&gt; <br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br /><br />Deirdre<br /><br /><br />

	<p>
	Deirdre:I'm not sure you've provided enough information to allow a recommendation on the "best" way to make a list of documents searchable, but I think it's possible to make a few helpful suggestions.In the examples you cite, "Meath County Development Plan" and "Navan Town Development Plan" you have Titles, not Subjects. Ergo, the Meta Tags should reflect that. If you want subjects as well, that'd be great, but you'd need to either extract some keywords from the documents or use a controlled vocabulary and search for appropriate terms. In the case of the titles you cite, you might also consider the DC element "Coverage" which allows you to specify the spatial extent "covered" by the document--in this case a town and a county.I hope this helps.Regards,Diane

        <br/>
          Hi.<br /><br />We were planning on including the following line in all pages:<br /><br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.creator&quot; content=&quot;Ordnance Survey, the national mapping<br />agency of Great Britain, xxx@ordnancesurvey.co.uk&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />However, we're getting more &amp; more spam to email addresses available on our websites.  To mitigate against this, we're planning on obfuscating (essentially hiding) the actual addresses available in MAILTOs using the principles detailed at http://www.mways.co.uk/prog/hidemail.php<br /><br />Bearing this in mind, I was wondering what your thoughts would be on including email addresses in DC.creator content?  Presumably it doesn't really make sense to obfuscate any email address included in this?  An alternative could be to include a URL to a contacts page (which included an obfuscated MAILTO) rather than an email address itself?  The documentation I have though (UK e-Government Metadata Standard v3.0) suggests including an email address in DC.creator.<br /><br />Look forward to hearing your thoughts.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br /><br />Rich.

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-05-04 09:19:00 by  Stuart Sutton</div>  
	<p>
	Rich, in all honesty, to include the email address of the creator of the resource in the metadata for the resource being described violates the Dublin Core &quot;one-to-one&quot; principle.  You can read more about this principle in the DCMI Abstract Model, section 3 (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/index.shtml/#sect-3" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/<BR>index.shtml/#sect-3</a> ) where it states: &quot;The abstract model described above indicates that each DCMI metadata description describes one, and only one, resource. This is commonly referred to as the one-to-one principle.&quot;  In terms of the creator's email address, we can say that the resource (say it is a document ) being described &quot;has-a&quot; creator and the creator &quot;has-a&quot; email address.  So, while we can say that the creator is a property of the resource being described, we _cannot_ say that the email address is a property of the resource--i.e., the document does not have an email address, the creator does!  So, &quot;email&quot; is not an apropriate refinement of the property creator in the description of a document under the DCMI Abstract Model.  In the end, what this means is that to make the metadata statement that &quot;Jane has the email address <a href="mailto:jane@here.org&quot" target=_BLANK>jane@here.org&quot</A>;, you need a metadata description of Jane (since the email address is a property of Jane ) that you reference from the creator property in your description of the document.

        <br/>
          Where a resource exists in translation as well as the original language, is the translation a version of the original (isVersionOf) or a related resource? Or is the original a &quot;source&quot; in that the translation is derived from it?

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-06-02 10:51:00 by  Diane I. Hillmann</div>  
	<p>
	Philip:If you are using Qualified DC, it is probably best to use IsVersionOf and HasVersion to relate the translation to the original and vice versa. Where this strategy has implications is when the information is "dumbed down" into Simple DC and the relationship information is lost. It is this issue that prompts some to use Source instead, but, of course, there is no reciprocality available. That said, in general we recommend the use of the Relation refinements rather than Source.Regards,Diane

	Benedict:The DCMI documentation does not, admittedly, contain the kinds of examples you're looking for. As you can well imagine, maintaining such a collection of examples, particularly in all the "flavors" people often want, would be a daunting task. I, like you, am often looking for examples. One strategy I often use for DCMI examples is to look through the Projects (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/ ) and see if you can find one that includes materials like the ones for which you need examples. Another strategy is to ask your question on the DC-General list (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/about/contact/#dcgeneral" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/about/contact/#dcgeneral</a> ) where many other implementers hang out.

How then, do I spcifiy that dc:coverage is the &quot;New York&quot; of http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=New+York&amp;place=&amp;nation=United+States&amp;prev_page=1&amp;english=Y&amp;subjectid=2539851 ?<br /><br />That URL is a bit too ugly to serve as red:resource? But if I use the name &quot;New York&quot;, you will not know that I refer to a place in Georgia, USA?

	Jan:In fact, unless you use Qualified Dublin Core and a schema that allows for the representation of controlled vocabularies, you can't specify controlled vocabularies at all. And, in the case you cite, that wouldn't help much, as you know.The ability that you (and we ) yearn for requires that the vocabulary owner identify terms with a URI. As you note, URLs (particularly ugly ones from database queries ) are not optimized for this task. This is a big gap in the Web infrastructure, one that will require basic agreements and on techology and strategy by vocabulary maintainers. There are steps being taken to get that process going, but it will take a while.In the meantime, may I suggest "New York, GA, USA" as a compromise for the interim?Regards,Diane

        <br/>
          We're trying to determine the most appropriate way of handling the title, creator, subject &amp; description field, etc. for chapters from a book, which is to be digitized in full and organized by chapter.  One approach would appear to be to  use the source field for the book as a whole, and the title, creator, description, etc. for each individual chapter, with Relation[IsPartof] referring to the source.  If so, should all the details on creator, description of the book be in the source field?<br /><br />  Another approach is to use multiple elements for both the book and the chapter (e.g. title, creator, description, etc. for both).  This might seem to be somewhat confusing and overly redundant, but separate individuals on our team have come up with differnt perspectives on which best facilitates discovery.  I've had little luck finding examples of how others have handled this; links to other collections would be greatly appreciated!<br /><br />Many thanks, cp

	Claudia: <br /> <br />It sounds like the chapters of this book have separate descriptive elements, and I think you're correct that it makes the most sense to consider this as a "part/whole" problem.   <br /> <br />You might consider having a record for the book as a whole, using the "hasPart" refinement for the Relation element to link to each chapter.  The chapters could then be described separately with an isPartOf reciprocal link to the original book.  I'd suggest that you not use Source for this strategy, since it does not have the advantage of the reciprocality of the Relation refinements. <br /> <br />What you include in the links depends on what you need to rationalize the information for your system and your users. A URI link would be optimal in some ways, but might not work well in your system. <br /> <br />Good luck with your project. <br /> <br />Regards, <br />Diane I.

	Mathew:I'm not clear what you're really asking. Dublin Core provides semantics to describe resources, and it's likely you'll be able to use it to describe the resources in your digital library. How you store and distribute the information you create, is an entirely different question, and really beyond the ability of this service to address. If you look at the Documents section on the webpage (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents</A>/ ) you will see some recommendations for use of various syntaxes. This might be a good place to start.Regards,Diane I. HillmannEditor, "Using Dublin Core"

          Hello there,<br /><br />I may sound very ignorant here, but I'm looking to put together a schema for a project that deals with film archives. We've done some research already which means that the Language the film was broadcast in, translates to DC.LANGUAGE and so on.<br /><br />But I would like to see what a database looks like in DC terms - can you point me at an example database file so I can take a look at a schema. As you can probably tell, I'm not really up on databases, so it would be nice to have a 'look' at one - if they exist in easy to read file formats - I suppose that depends whether it's relational or flat db right?<br /><br />Hope this is all clear.<br /><br />Many thanks!<br /><br />Ian

	Ian, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere for database expertise. You might look at some of the project pages at the DCMI website (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/ ) and see if there's any other projects that are similar to what you hope to do, and contact them directly.There's also another question similar to yours in the archives of this service (see: <a href="http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/default.aspx?from=srch&id=6436&t=RDBMS" target=_BLANK>http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/default.aspx?from=srch&id=6436&t=RDBMS</a> )If these strategies don't work for you, you might consider asking for some assistance on the DC-General mailing list. There is a lot of expertise out there, and often generous implementers, too!

          Hi, we are trying to implement the dublin core on our web publishing project. Can you clarify for me the relationship between the legacy meta description &amp; keyword tags which the search engines used to rely on, and the dc equivalent tag - basically what are the dc equivalents, and is it neccessary to use both or do the dc's supercede the older tags?

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-03-24 11:02:00 by  ASKDCMI Administrator</div>

	Jamie:There's really no explicit relationship between HTML META tags and Dublin Core, so it's hard to answer your question easily. Much of the answer depends on what you're trying to do, particularly given that it's not clear that many or any of the search engines pay much attention to either META tags or Dublin Core. I'd suggest that you take some time to clarify your goals, think about who might want to use your information (aside from the search engines ), and do what makes the most sense in meeting those goals.Regards,Diane I.

	The work on the Dublin Core started with an invitational workshop, exactly 10 years ago today on March 1-3, 1995, at OCLC in Dublin, Ohio, USA (see: <A href="http://dublincore.org/workshops/dc1/">http://dublincore.org/workshops/dc1/</A>). The location of that meeting was what gave the Initiative its name.

        <br/>
          I am looking at creating metadata for the webpages, manuscript records and images of a library Special Collections department. To comply with MINERVA technical standards, 'to support the discovery of their resources by a wide range of other applications and services, projects must capture and store sufficient descriptive metadata for each item using simple DC'. If search engines do not use this data, and there is no central index or catalogue to submit the DC records to, what will be the benefit of having them? How will these other resources and applications find us? Thank you for your help.

	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-02-26 05:03:00 by  Andy Powell</div>  
	<p>
	I would tend to look at this requirement in a couple of ways.  In the short term, capturing metadata at the level of simple DC may help with the management of your collection of resources.  You may also be able to re-use it internally within your service as the basis of your internal search engine.  Remember that (I assume ) you may choose to store your metadata internally using some other format (e.g. MARC ) as long as you know how to transform it into DC as and when it is necvessary to do so.  You might also choose to expose your metadata using the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting as simple DC (oai_dc ), so that services like ARC and OAIster can harvest it.  The latter will result in your metadata becoming available thru Yahoo.Finally, I'd consider any simple DC metadata you create now in the context of your longer term 'preservation' metadata requirements.  Clearly, simple DC won't provide everything you need here - but it will be a start.

	Hello Jussi,Qualified DC offers two element refinements of dc:relation that you can use: dcterms:isPartOf and  dcterms:hasPart.  These two element refinements express "parent/child" relationships, where as in your example the HTML document is the "parent" and the attachments are the "children."  This approach follows your second idea, "this document contains these documents, here is their metadata."Seehttp://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/andhttp://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/qualifiers.shtml#isPartOffor further explanation.Regards,Holly

	Hello,In addition to the 15 Dublin Core elements you can use element refinements and encoding schemes.  The usage guide created by Diane Hillman provides examples:  <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide</A>/.

        <br/>
          I need to be more specific in my metadata than merely &quot;subject.&quot;  No refinements exist for this element.  Can I, without breaching the spirit of DCMI, introduce my own refinements, such as, e.g.:<br />subject.relative<br />subject.pupil<br />subject.publisher<br />subject.artist<br />subject.composer<br />subject.writer<br /><br />and so on?<br /><br />Ideally, there would be two levels of subject refinement, the first level having:<br /><br />subject.person<br />subject.institution<br />subject.place<br /><br />and the second level further subdividing, e.g.:<br /><br />subject.person.relative<br />subject.person.pupil<br />subject.person.artist<br /><br />and so on.<br /><br />-- Ian Bent

	Ian:The reason that no refinements exist for this element is that it is intended for use with controlled vocabularies, which are far more interoperable in general than refinements. The refinement scheme that you propose might work perfectly well within your own domain, but is unlikely to be suitable for (or easily explained to ) anyone else using your data.So, to answer your specific question: you would be breaching both the spirit and the practice of DCMI by introducing the refinements you suggest. It would be much better from an interoperability standpoint to set up local vocabularies to meet your goals for specificity. Better yet would be exposing them to others for re-use, but that may be a future enhancement.Regards,Diane I. HillmannEditor, "Using Dublin Core"

A look at the DCMI Projects page (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/ ) should give you a sampling, but we have no way of knowing the real numbers (or names ) of all DC implementers.We hope that in five years, DCMI will be an organization with much better funding(! ), but we have no crystal ball to help us know the future. After 10 years of operation, DCMI is a significant organization with an excellent track record, still going strong--I'm not sure we could ask for much more than that.Regards,Diane I.

          Does the URI http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_hastings identify a battle, or a wikipedia article?<br /><br />Could that be resolved by identifying the battle with URN:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_hastings<br />and the article with URL:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_hastings<br />?

	<br />For me there is no doubt that the URI you specify refers to the Wikipedia article. In an early article <A href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html">http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Axioms.html</A>, Tim Berners-Lee states that an URI refers to something "on the Web". I know there are some discussions in various place on whether and how to assign URIs to physical entities (such as people) but I don't think there is consensus on how one would assign a URI to an event like the Battle of Hastings.<br />

        <br/>
          Hi,<br />We do electronic edition of older paper journals articles,and we want to describe them with DC elements and refinements in XML. So, what is better to use:<br />- first, to link the article electronic version to the paper version: 'source' or 'isFormatOf';for now, we don't make changes between the 2 versions. Is there a formal denomination to write the reference of the paper article in the element/refinement(ie: journal name,date,vol, number, page, article title, or so)?<br />- then, to link the electronic resource to its electronic collection, what value must be used in isPartOf refinement: url of the electronic issue table of content(I saw it somewhere), url of the journal welcome page, issn, journal title (short and long), other...<br />- then, I think that all date refinements are for described electronic resource, and not for older paper resource; is it right, or is there a refinement for the paper resource?<br />Apologize for my english speaking, thank you very much for your answer, sincerely
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2005-01-27 09:34:00 by  Ann Apps</div>  
	<p>
	<br />1. I think it would be better to use dcterms:isFormatOf to link the electronic version of the article to the paper version, if you have a URI for that information. Using dc:source is another option and would not be wrong, but isFormatOf seems better to me. However if you do not have a URI, which is probably the case for a printed version, you should use dc:source because the value of dc:source can be a text string.<br /><br />2. You can include the bibliographic citation details for the article as the value of a dcterms:bibliographicCitation property. This is a refinement of dc:identifier. The citation details effectively identify a journal article. The DCMI Citation Working Group are writing some Guidelines for encoding this information within a Dublin Core description. These are available at <A href="http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/DC/dc-citation-guidelines/">http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/DC/dc-citation-guidelines/</A> but note that this is still a working draft. However this document does not yet explain how to encode this information in XML, because the guidelines for encoding DC metadata in XML need updating and are not yet agreed. So if you want to use an XML encoding of citation information then you may wish to use a different metadata scheme that has been designed to describe bibliographic items (some are indicated in the guidelines document). Of course if your XML encoding is just within your own application you can choose yourself how to do it.<br /><br />3. The citation guidelines recommend including the ISSN of a journal as the value of a dcterms:isPartOf property for an article. This should be encoded as a URI (ie. urn:issn:), as detailed in the guidelines. However, isPartOf can be repeated, so you could also include an isPartOf property that is the URL of the issue table of contents, or of the journal. Which you choose will depend on your application, and where you want a user to link to to find the journal issue.<br /><br />4. The dcterms:issued property is usually used for the issue date for a journal issue. For a journal that is also published in print, this is the date shown on the cover.  Alternatively, you could include this issue date with the 'date' key in an OpenURL ContextObject if you follow the citation guidelines (explained in there).  You would use another date refinement for when the electronic article itself was made available - either dcterms:available or dc:date.<br />

	James: Apologies for the delay in answering your question. This information was provided by Erica Olsen of the Laboratory of Ornithology at Cornell University:  <br />*********************  <br /> <br />Here are some examples of what is currently being done on the web in these areas... The NISO Technical metadata for still images standard describes just about everything you could ever want to say about a still image. This is definitely overkill, but it's a great start. Their data dictionary can be found here: http://www.niso.org/standards/resources/Z39_87_trial_use.pdf  <br /> <br />Alternately, the Getty image collection has a good example of how information about still images can be presented on the web in a user-friendly fashion: http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/home/homeCreative.aspx  <br /> <br />For sounds and video, there are fewer formal digital metadata standards. The University of Virginia has published their guidelines here: http://www.lib.virginia.edu/digital/reports/DLMRPGroupReport.htm  <br />The Defense Technical Information Center has published Video and Audio metadata guidelines for their collections: http://dvl.dtic.mil/metadata_guidelines/dvl_video_guidelines19Jun01.pdf http://dvl.dtic.mil/metadata_guidelines/dvl_sound_guidelines19Jun01.pdf  <br /> <br />The Vincent Voice Library at Michigan State University has a gallery of sound files from it's collection. You can look through and see how they chose to display information about audio recordings on the web: http://www.historicalvoices.org/earliest_voices/  <br /> <br />Finally, here at the Lab, we have a beta version of the Macaulay Library sound and video marine catalog that is (rather quietly ) available online: http://mlsource.ornith.cornell.edu/dam/ The search results and item detail pages can give you an idea of which metadata items we thought were important to display for audio recordings.  <br /> <br />***************************  <br />Regards, and good luck on your project.

	Actually, there is a term "hasVersion", with the definition:"The described resource has a version, edition, or adaptation, namely, the referenced resource".  It is a refinement ofdc:relation and therefore intended to express the relationship between two resources, one of which is "a version of" theother.However, you are perhaps looking for an element to identify "the version of the resource described" -- for example, a versionnumber like "1.0" or "1.1" (i.e., a "Version Identifier" ).The need to identify version is clear in a general sense,but it is not immediately obvious how one would expressversion in a generic sense, and therefore how the element should be defined.  Even assuming a generic concept could be defined, it is not immediately obvious how a separate elementwould serve the cause of resource discovery more effectivelythan simply including the version number in the title of theresource (which is often appropriate ) or in its free-text description.According to DCMI process, such issues would need to be addressed and documented in a formal proposal for a new term to the DCMI Usage Board.  However, pastexperience withquestions related to identifiers suggests that the path to auseful consensus on this issue could be longer than one mightinitially assume.

        <br/>
          Hello! There was a standard set of genre types for use in the Dublin Core Type element created by Resource Type and Format Working Group. It looks like &quot;Text.Article&quot;, &quot;Text.Homepage&quot;, &quot;Text.Homepage.Organizational&quot;, &quot;Text.Homepage.Personal&quot; etc. On the Dublincore.org I found that it is no longer valid for the DC scheme. Does it mean that DCMI suggests to define this genre type of the resource on one's own? How can I describe an online dictionary? As “Dataset” or “Dataset.Dictionary”?<br />Thank you for helping

	Hello. <BR><BR>The current DC vocabulary for Type can be found at http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/ . <BR><BR>The controlled vocabulary you mention was a recommendation of the DC Type working group, but was not approved by the Usage Board. You may define your own genre types, but you may also use one of the registered Dublin Core controlled vocabularies or encoding schemes. <BR><BR>See <A href="http://dublincore.org/resources/faq/#controlledvocab">http://dublincore.org/resources/faq/#controlledvocab</A> . <BR>

        <br/>
          Hello,<br /><br />We are interested in cataloging highly self-referential canonical works. We would like to capture such common relationships as:<br /><br />Relation.TranslationOf<br />Relation.CommentaryOn<br /><br />Further, there are some commonly accepted (but not definitive) authorative works often used as reference. When someone makes a translation of an ancient text they often refer to it by its similarity to a work done in London 150 years ago. They might refer to something more popular found on the net:<br /><br />Relation.SimilarTo<br />Relation.IndexReference<br /><br />Don't seem to cut it. Have we overlooked definitions found elsewhere in DC, is there a standard way to extend DC? If not, I would like to suggest these added to the core DC definition, particularly TranslationOf, as it seems a very common relationship.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Alex Genaud

	Alex,You can extend the Dublin Core metadata vocabularies by defining your own properties as sub-properties (refinements ) of DC properties i.e. in the same way that DCMI declares its <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/isPartOf" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/terms/isPartOf</A> property to be a sub-property of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation</A>, so you can declare (for example ) <a href="http://your.example.org/terms/isTranslationOf" target=_BLANK>http://your.example.org/terms/isTranslationOf</A> to be a sub-property of <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation.This" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/relation.This</A> does depend on (a ) your assigning a persistent URI to your property;(b ) your making available the information about this relationship between your new property and the DCMI property - either in a human-readable document or using an RDF Schema description - so that applications processing your metadata instances can take advantage of that information;(c ) your observing the semantics of the sub-property relationship i.e. subproperty means that "If property A is a sub-property of property B, then whenever two resources are related by property A, they are also related by property B" - and this applies for all occurrences of the property A.Metadata implementers can make proposals to the DCMI Usage Board for new properties to be added to the DCMI vocabularies, so you could make a proposal for, e.g, an "isTranslationOf" property - though it may be more likely for your proposal to gain Usage Board support if you can show the support of a community of implementers. Details of the process for proposing new terms are available athttp://<a href="www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#four.Incidentally" target=_BLANK>www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/process/#four.Incidentally</a>, the current DCMI recommendations for encoding DC metadata in XHTML, XML and RDF prefer the use of the refinement name "stand alone" with the information about the refinement relationship being obtained from a source external to the metadata instance, rather than the "[name of element].[name of element-refinement]" convention.

	Sam, the answer is a bit buried in DCMI documentation.  The actual definitions are part of the Usage Board process document at <a href="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/process</A>/ subpart 3.  Actually, from the DCMI Terms page (<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms</a>/ ), in the tables declaring the DCMI properties, you will find a row for "Status".  The status text is an active link to the definitions in the process document.

It appears to be centralized around Internet protocols. <br /><br />We are looking for these types of standards (for meta data repositories).

See section 3.1 of RFC 3406 Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespace Definition Mechanisms <A href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3406.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3406.html</A> <BR><BR>I'm guessing that you obtained it from the RSLP Collection Description tool <A href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/rslp/tool/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/rslp/tool/</A> which I think uses some randomisation algorithm to generate those strings.If you are using URNs in a live system, I think the recommendation would be to use only registered URN Namespace Ids <A href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces">http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces</A> <BR>if you wish to be sure of guaranteeing the uniqueness of your identifiers.RDF does not require the use of URNs; you could assign identifiers based on any URI scheme.

          I am a database/data warehouse administrator. I like the Dublin Core idea for metadata elements.  <br /><br />Has anyone used the Dublin Core elements for creating SQL database metadata?  I have to make the distinction - this is not storing metadata in a database, but rather storing metadata about the database. <br /><br />This could include Tables, columns, data types, column widths, data sources, data targets, etc.  Do you have a template or a standard? <br /><br />Documenting databases using the Dublin Core...  I love the idea of standard metadata elements list that could be used to bring disparate database metadata together.  I just don't want to re-invent the wheel. <br /><br />Thank you so much for your help, <br />Bill Preachuk.     <br /><br />

If so, in RDF, that is represented as a Class, with the URIref http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/CollectionTo indicate that a resource is an instance of this type, in RDF/XML you would use<rdf:RDF .... >  <dcmitype:Collection rdf:about="http://example.org/mycollection/">    <dc:title>My collection</dc:title>  </dcmitype:Collection></rdf:RDF>or<rdf:RDF .... >  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://example.org/collection/">    <dc:title>My collection</dc:title>    <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection"/>  </rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>Pete Johnston

          On this page:<br />http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/index.asp?id=5810<br />the answerer has provided some code (some I would be actually genuinely interested in looking at) but it does not actually appear in the answer. I suspect this is some issue with the left- and right-angle brackets, or something to that effect.  Should be pretty easy to fix.<br /> I filed this under Documentation since there wasn't a category for &quot;Website Issues&quot;.

          Almost all of the options available under the drop-down to pick Subject Area are invisible.  Only the top-level headings are readable.  The invisible ones are selectable, and become visible when selected, but it makes it difficult to find the correct catagory, because you have to pick every single option until you find the one you are looking for.<br />Bug info: I am using MacOS X 10.3.2, and MS Internet Explorer 5.2.3.  The problem is consistent and repeatable, after restarts and after loging in again on a different day.  The code doesn't look mangled to me; I think it may just been too many non-breaking space chars. for MSIE to digest or something.  The problem does not appear in the Safari Browser v 1.2.3, so it is probably MSIE-specific.  I filed this under Documentation since there wasn't a category for &quot;Website Issues&quot;.

          Hello,<br />I had to work on DC HTML meta tags on a project where pages already contained DC elements like &quot;DC.creator.corporateName&quot;. I never found any informations on dublincore.org in the &quot;Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1&quot; but I found something abour subElements in the archives :<br />http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/02/11/subelement/<br />But this draft is closed since 1998 and it doesn't seem that it will evolve into a recommandation as the work group is currently disabled.<br />So, do you know if subElements are still usable and in case they are, where can I find up-to-date informations about them ?<br /><br />Shears,<br />Nicolas.

          What's the difference between DC.date DCTERMS.issued?  I'm afraid I don't see the point of these DCTERMS things, and thought the old system of DC.something.modifier was much clearer.

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2004-09-22 18:32:00 by  Andy Powell</div>  
	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> DCTERMS.issued has narrower semantics than DC.date. Its usage allows consumers of the metadata to know what kind of date is being encoded - rather than it just being 'any old' date.<br /><br />I agree that in this form of encoding, the name of the element refinement is less intuitive to human readers than it might be - DCTERMS.dateIssued would have been better. All new DC element refinements are being given more intuitive names.<br /> <p />

          Bonjour,<br />is it licit to use an encoding scheme as if it were a property ?<br />Indeed, in an XML implementation of a DC AP, I would like to write :<br />&lt;dc.identifier&gt;  &lt;dcterms.URI&gt;http://www.uri.fr&lt;/dcterms.uri&gt;<br />&lt;/dc.identifier&gt;<br />I know that it is not recommended to use refinements as subelements (and a fortiori, it should not be recommended for schemes). But, except this point, is my code licit ?<br />Thanks<br />Yann

          Dear all,<br /><br />I don't know if this is the right address to ask the following question but lets give it a try. <br /><br />I am working on one of the next generation optical disc based storage systems. Within the international working group that is dealing with this, it was proposed to include Dublin Core Metadata Descriptors into the specification. <br /><br />The following questions have been raised and I was asked to find out answers. It would be a great help if you could provide some insights:<br /><br />Q1: Would it be possible to duplicate descriptions for some or all of the Dublin Core descriptors in such a new optical disc specification? If yes, under what conditions?<br /><br />Q2: There are multiple documents describing the Dublin Core Descriptor set (e.g. ISO, DCMI, IETF). What would be the most appropriate document to reference?<br /><br />Q3: Is there any IPR policy for the Dublin Core Metadata Descriptors?<br /><br />Q4: Are there any IPR claims to be expected upon the inclusion of Dublin Core Metadata Descriptors?<br /><br />Thank you for your kind help<br />Ralf Ostermann<br />THOMSON

        <br/>
          I'm curious if there is a study that looks at DC metadata user requirements.  For example, how do those that access a DC metadata record use the various elements?  I understand from the definitions what the elements are intended for, but how do the users see the elements?  For example, I did a user needs assessment for the US Forest Service and several respondants indicated that they use &quot;resource type&quot; to determine the quality of a catalogued information product.  Anyway, if you know of such a study that focusses on the metadata fields (as opposed to an information service) I would appreciate a lead to it.  Thanks, Eric

	Eric:Sorry for the delay in answering your question. I don't think that there's anything specifically that looks at user needs in quite the way you're looking for information. However, I'd suggest two places to start:One is some thesis research done by Jewel Ward:Link:<a href="http://www.foar.net/research/index.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.foar.net/research/index.html</A>Abstract:Jewel Ward. A Quantitative Analysis of Dublin Core Metadata Element Set(DCMES ) Usage in Data Providers Registered with the Open ArchivesInitiative (OAI ). A Master's paper for the M.S. inI.S. degree. November, 2002. 68 pages. Advisor: Gregory B. NewbyThis research describes an empirical study of how the Dublin Core MetadataElement Set (DCMES ) is used by 100 Data Providers (DPs ) registered withthe Open Archives Initiative (OAI ). The research was conducted todetermine whether or not the DCMES is used to its full capabilities. Eighty-two of 100 DPs have metadata records available for analysis. DCMES usage varies by type of DP. The average number of Dublin Core elements per record is eight, with an average of 91,785 Dublin Core elements used per DP. Five of the 15 elements of the DCMES are used 71% of the time. The results show the DCMES is not used to its fullest extent within DPs registered with OAI.Another is some research being done by Liz Liddy at Syracuse University.

If the former, then I'm not aware of any of the major search engines that do very much with embedded metadata (XML or otherwise ). Local site-specific search engine software is more likely to be configurable to index embedded metadata but I don't have any specific details. <p />

Is there a program available somewhere (in java of C++ for instance) that automatically translates b028 to title, b036 to creator, and so forth.<br /><br /><br />Please advise and thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Michael

          I miss a value in DCMI Type Vocabulary to specify that an entity is an organization (or a person), like in http://landsbank.fo/test/about.rdf

	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>UKOLN, University of Bath <p /> This value is intentionally missing from the DCMI Type vocabulary because that vocabulary is limited to the classes of things that DC is intended to be used to describe. So, for the time being you'll have to invent your own vocabulary for this - or find another existing vocabulary that has this term. You could ask for further help on the dc-agents working group mailing list. <p />

        <br/>
          W3C (http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-uri-collision) discourages URL overloading. <br /><br />Does that mean I should not use http://landsbank.fo/ to identify both my organization, and <br /><br />its web site? After all, the organization was founded in 1988, the web page several years <br /><br />later. And while while I am resonsible for the web page <br /><br />(http://www.nic.fo/custom2/lookup/domain.asp?searchtext=LANDSBANK.FO&amp;go=Leita), my boss is <br /><br />responsible for the entire organization <br /><br />(http://www.gulu.fo/Virki.vit?VirkiId=382809&amp;language=2).<br /><br />Then again, at http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#indirect-identification W3C seems to encourage indirect identification, thus allowing the same URI to identify both web site and organization.<br /><br />WHen using Dublin Core - do you think I should overload http://landsbank.fo/ as an <br />indirect identification of the organization?

	<p>
	Hi Jan,I'm afraid I couldn't read the text of Andy's earlier reply because the AskDCMI system seemed to have done something strange with the character encoding, but I'm guessing Andy's advice was that if you wish to describe both an organisation and its web page or web site then you need to assign different URIs for those two things. Re your follow up, yes, it seems to me it's a good idea to avoid embedding in your resource identifiers information that is specific to your server-side implementation (".asp", ".jsp" etc ). Also I think it is important to distinguish between identification and "interaction". If I assign the URI <a href="http://example.org/myOrganisation" target=_BLANK>http://example.org/myOrganisation</A> to my organisation, it may well be that I configure my HTTP server, so that when someone issues an HTTP GET on that URI, they receive an HTML document in response. That is fine: that HTML document is a representation of the resource (my organisation ). However, if I wish to describe that HTML document separately, then I need a separate URI to refer to the document e.g. <a href="http://example.org/myOrganisation/intro.html" target=_BLANK>http://example.org/myOrganisation/intro.html</A>. Now if someone issues a GET on that URI, they may retrieve exactly the same document i.e. the HTML document is its own representation (as well as being a representation of my organisation ).   So in the case of the XHTML namespace URI, by definition (or through its use as an XML Namespace name ) that URI identifies/denotes an XML namespace. It's fine for W3C to return an HTML document when someone dereferences the XML namespace name - but if they want to make statements about both the XML namespace and that HTML document, then (as you suggest ) they need separate URIs for those two things.Re the W3C indirect identification section in the W3C TAG document, I don't think they are advocating using the same URI to denote two different things. I think they are careful to distinguish between global and local scope: e.g. locally, it may be OK to use <a href="mailto:mailto:nadia@example.com" target=_BLANK>mailto:nadia@example.com</A> as an indirect identifier for a person, but in the global context it is quite possible that another party is using that URI to refer to a mailbox (which is what the mailto: URI scheme says it identifies ). So when exposing your local data to the rest of the world you would need to use conventions like "the person with the mailbox <a href="mailto:mailto:nadia@example.com" target=_BLANK>mailto:nadia@example.com</A>". So to go back to your question, I think it is problematic to use the same URI to identify both an organisation and a website, and it is easier/safer to use two distinct URIs. It may well be the case that both those URIs dereference to the same representation, but as identifiers they denote two different resources, and you can clearly and unambiguously make statements about those two different resources.RegardsPete Johnston

        <div class="h4">Question asked on: 2004-08-24 00:00:00 by Ricki-Ellen Brooke</div>
        <br/>
          Is there a standard -- eg. either comma or semi-colon deliminated -- for separating multiple subject terms in the 'subject' element?  I've seen the DC note: &quot;If multiple vocabulary terms or keywords are used, either separate terms with semi-colons or use separate iterations of the Subject element&quot;.  But w3.org states: &quot;Provide keywords and descriptions: Some indexing engines look for META elements that define a comma-separated list of keywords/phrases... Consider these examples,<br />&lt;META name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;vacation,Greece,sunshine&quot;&gt;<br /><br />Is there a standard or most-used form? Or maybe it doesn't matter if one uses commas or semi-colons to separate multiple subject terms?<br /><br />Thanks for any guidance.

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Ricki-Ellen:<br /><br />"Using Dublin Core" recommends using a semi-colon to separate multiple subject terms in the same element instance. Because DC elements are repeatable, using separate element instances is even less ambiguous. <br /><br />Commas often aren't a good idea where subject terms might use a comma within a term. LCSH subjects, for instance, often us commas to move the most important term to the beginning of the phrase. This makes a comma in such a list highly ambiguous--one cannot tell what its function actually is in that situation.<br /><br />I suspect that the W3C folks are most likely to think of subjects as merely keywords, not subject terms that may be part of a complex controlled vocabulary. <br /><br />So, yes, it matters--how much depends on what your goals are and with whom you're sharing data.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I. Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

          The description of dcterms:available says &quot;Date (often a range)...&quot;  I have been unable to find out just HOW to represent a range correctly.  I know a single date would be &quot;2004-08-19&quot; but what about a range???  Thanks.

	<p>
	 Holly Mercer<br>University of Kansas Coordinator of Digital Content Development <p /> Kurt,<br />The date recorded as 2004-08-19 follows the recommended encoding scheme for dates, namely W3CDTF, an application of ISO8601. You are correct that W3CDTF describes single dates only; it does not specify how to encode a date range or period of time. If you wish to follow an encoding scheme to express date available, you can use the Dublin Core Period encoding scheme <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period</A>/ a DCMI recommendation. Other options include: ISO 8601 (range expressed as YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD ), AACR2R or other cataloging rules for expressing date ranges, or you may opt not to use an encoding scheme. <p />

        <br/>
          I am generating Dublic Core meta-data for a customer as part of an Open Archive Initiatives static repository. The customer has asked me to put HTML formatting elements (such as paragraph, subscript, and superscript) and HTML character entities inside elements of the Dublin Core XML representation. They are suggesting that I do so by wrapping the HTML in a CDATA section. While this will clear validate against the schema, it does not seem to be in the spirit of Dublin Core. Is such an approach acceptable use of Dublin Core, or should only plain text be used?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br />Will.

	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2004-09-22 18:09:00 by  Andy Powell</div>  
	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>UKOLN, University of Bath <p /> I agree that this is against the spirit of simple DC. Use plain text in the element values. If you want to do richer stuff, then declare a separate metadata format (i.e. develop a different XML schema ) and then use that.<br /><br />Note, DC tends to refer to values that contain markup as 'rich values'. These are (conceptually ) acceptable in qualified DC - but I'm not aware of any off-the-shelf XML schemas that support them. <p />

          In the DC documentation there's talk about different XML structures that can be used to include DC metadata.<br />Suppose I want to store Created Date in W3C-DTF format.

Metadata for an event provides descriptive information that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration, responsible agents, and links to related events and resources. A resource of type Sound is content primarily intended to be rendered as audio. Therefore, a transcript from a round table discussion could be <br />Type="Event" and Type="Text" (with any other vocabulary you wish to use ). <br />The recorded audio of that same round table discussion could be both <br />Type=Event" and Type="Sound." <br />The Type element need not specify whether the resource is available online.

	 Holly Mercer<br>University of Kansas Lawrence, KansasCoordinator of Digital Content Development <p /> There are several ways to include edition information in a Dublin Core record, but no single authoritative approach.<br /><br />1.  Use the isVersionOf / hasVersion refinements of the Relation element.  From  SUsing Dublin Core  <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide</A>/:<br />Most of the refinements of Relation are expressed as "reciprocals" and may be used to link resources in two directions, though this is not required. Implementors need not describe both or all resources involved in a reciprocal relationship to express the relationship--in other words, they may describe a later version and relate it to the earlier without having the need or opportunity to describe the earlier, and vice versa. In some of the relationships below, maintaining reciprocality is more important. In others, one direction of the relationship is more relevant than the other. These differences will be mentioned in the guidelines for specific terms.<br />In All cases, either a string or a URI may be used as a value. If a URI is used, the scheme should be designated.   You may find the example given in  SUsing Dublin Core  helpful.<br /><br />2.  You can use the bibliographicCitation element refinement of Identifier and incorporate a bibliographic citation (including an edition statement ) for your resource. See <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/qualifiers.shtml#bibliographicCitation" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/qualifiers.shtml#bibliographicCitation</a>. <br /><br />3.  If you wish to note the edition of the print version from which an electronic resource was derived, you can use Source. Recommended best practice is to reference the resource by means of a string or number conforming to a formal identification system, but you can include a citation or other string, as is done in this example taken from the User Guide:  Source="Image from page 54 of the 1922 edition of Romeo and Juliet"<br /><br />4.  The Dublin Core Libraries Work Group has also dealt with this.  The DC-Lib application profile (current version <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/09/24/library-application-profile" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/09/24/library-application-profile</a>/ ) recommends using Edition from the MODS namespace <<a href="http://www.loc.gov/mods" target=_BLANK>http://www.loc.gov/mods</A> >.  The DCMI Usage Board supports using terms (such as encoding schemes ) from existing namespaces instead of creating new terms to extend Dublin Core.  <br /><br />The method you should to employ depends on how you will use the Dublin Core records.  The Dublin Core Libraries application profile (DC-Lib ) will provide a rich description of resources, but that richness may be lost if you wish to share your metadata records through OAI metadata harvesters.<br /><br /> <p />

	 Palle Aagaard<br> <p /> Dear lulzim,<br /><br />Try to look at "Adoption of Dublin Core by governments" via <a href="http://www.dublincore.org/news/adoption" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/news/adoption</A>/ . Here you can find several governments standards or rules for using DC.<br /><br />If you are in doubt of which elements which are appropriate you can also go to different national websites and look at how and which DCMI metadata are actually embedded. Try e.g. the Danish national government information website <a href="www.danmark.dk" target=_BLANK>www.danmark.dk</A> and look at "source" in your browser. But other major national website around the world can also have embedded DC elements.<br /><br /><br />If you have further questions - then write back<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Palle<br /><br /><br /><br /> <p />

          We are planning to use the Dublin Core for our XML content repository,<br />and I need some help on how to include an ID element in the XML<br />documents that are based on the Dublin Core XML Schemas. What I'd like<br />to do is assign a unique system generated ID within the XML documents.<br />The Dublin Core does not have an ID element, however, XML Schemas, by<br />default, allow an ID attribute to a type. For example, an element can be<br />defined as &lt;xsd:attribute name=&quot;DocID&quot; type=&quot;xsd:ID&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />Can you recommend a solution? Should we create our version of the Simple<br />Dublin Core by adding the ID attribute?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Alex Fajardo<br />AEGONUSA, Inc.<br />727-299-1800 ext. 3433<br />

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> When encoding DC in XML you have to declare the container element yourself - because it is application specific. Therefore, you are free to declare the container element in such a way that it makes use of an ID attribute. <p />

          I'm trying to map TEI headers for a publication to current DCMI recommendations for use in HTML output. I'm baffled by the new schema-based DCTERMS syntax for element refinements. I understand in principle how it works. But what do I do if I want the current form of an old-fashioned refinement like this: &lt;meta name=&quot;DC.contributor.editor&quot; content=&quot;Doe, John&quot;/&gt;? There is no &quot;editor&quot; refinement in the DCMI Metadata Terms recommendation. Do I need to find a schema that defines it? Write my own? Just use the old form?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> David:<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure what you mean by the "old form." "Editor" was never an approved DCMI refinement, but was certainly used locally by some implementations.<br /><br />The Dublin Core Usage Board is currently in the process of defining a role vocabulary for use with Contributor, based on LC's relator terms. Progress has been slower than we'd like, primarily because there are administrative and technical issues involved. When the vocabulary is available, you will certainly see an announcement on the DCMI webspace.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> I haven't seen the error you describe and do not have access to XML Spy.<br /><br />We have found that some validating parsers do throw errors when processing the complexTypes in dcterms.xsd based on the SimpleLiteral type. However, based on comments on the XMLSchema-dev list and our testing with some of the major parsers such as XSV and MSXML, we felt that this usage was correct. See Appendix A of the Notes at<br /><br /><a href="http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04</a>/<br />02/notes/<br /><br />for more details.<br /><br />The major rationale for defining the SimpleLiteral type as we did was for maximum flexibility. We expected implementors to be able both to extend and restrict this type to meet their own needs.<br /><br />If you knew you would never need/want to extend the SimpleLiteral to allow child elements, you could simplify the schemas by taking a copy and changing the SimpleLiteral type in dc.xsd to a simpleContent model something like:<br /><br /><xs:complexType name="SimpleLiteral"><br /> <xs:simpleContent><br /> <xs:extension base="xs:anySimpleType"><br /> <xs:attribute ref="xml:lang" use="optional"/><br /> </xs:extension><br /> </xs:simpleContent><br /></xs:complexType><br /><br />Regards<br />Pete Johnston <p />

          We are looking to implement a standard for our XHTML document metadata.<br /><br />Is a mixture of HTML metadata tags, for example, &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot; /&gt; and the new DC standard, for example, &lt;meta name=&quot;DC.description&quot; content=&quot;&quot; /&gt; sensible? <br /><br />Will search engines such as Google pick up DC metadata or should we still be using the old style of HTML metadata?<br /><br />If DC elements are used, is it essential to link to a scheme? (&lt;link rel=&quot;schema.DC&quot; href=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; /&gt;)<br /> <br />If we use DCTERMS elements would we have to link to the DCTERMS scheme?

	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>UKOLN, University of Bath <p /> No, Google and most of the other big search engines will not make use of embedded DC metadata.<br /><br />Linking to the schema is recommended but not really essential - but if you do decide to link to the schema and you use the DCTERMS namespace, then yes you do need to link to that schema as well.<br /><br />I'm not aware of a document that discusses the benefits of using DC metadata as such. In general, I would recommend only embedding DC metadata where you control both the content and the search engine - for example, it might be sensible to embed DC metadata into your own pages if your internal/site search engine has been configured to make use of the embedded metadata. <p />

The pubic broadcasting system in the US is working on a metadata effort, described in a paper presented at the DC 2003 conference (see: <a href="http://www.siderean.com/dc2003/search.jsp?sm=fr3%3BBT340%3B0http://www.dcmi.org%2Fdcconf%2F2003%23Schemas7%3BSchemas" target=_BLANK>http://www.siderean.com/dc2003/search.jsp?sm=fr3%3BBT340%3B0http:/<BR>/www.dcmi.org%2Fdcconf%2F2003%23Schemas7%3BSchemas</a> ) <br /><br />It might also be useful to check the DCMI Projects page for projects in progress in your topic area (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

	 Stuart Sutton<br>Professor in the Information School. Member of the DCMI Usage Board and the DCMI Advisory Board. Co-Chair of the DC-Education Working Group. <p /> The audience element is indeed a full-fledged DC element. As with *all* new element additions to DC, it was put into a namespace separate from the original 15 elements (<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/terms</A>/ ). It has a status of "recommended" which is the same status as was given title, description etc. in DC. I, too, work on a project that had its own audience element. When this element was approved on 21 May 2001, we changed our usage to the DCMI namespace. Please note, however, that there are a number of new elements and element refinements that have been assigned the status of "conforming". They, too, are full-fledged DC elements and can be used effectively wherever there is a need. The "conforming" status means nothing more than: (1 ) the element was considered by the Usage Board to be useful for a specific domain but perhaps not generally useful across domains; and/or (2 ) its use was for purposes other than discovery. <p />

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> Hello Tsach,<br /><br />Yes, your example is fine. For consistency to human readers, DCMI tends to use the prefixes "dc", "dcterms" and "dcmitype" in its documentation and in its XML documents. <br /><br />But to an application, the prefix used in the XML QName doesn't matter. RDF/XML makes use of XML QNames and XML Namespaces purely as a mechanism for representing URI references, and the prefix used is transparent to the application. <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston <p />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Rachel:<br /><br />Our general advice for projects using a more granular or domain specific type terminology is to add a DCMIType term in a separate Type iteration as well. This ensures that if another implementer doesn't wish to use your type vocabulary, they still have a vocabulary they can use and understand. It's not really necessary to link the vocabularies in a hierarchy to accomplish this kind of simple interoperability.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

        <div class="h4">Question asked on: 2004-05-22 00:00:00 by Peter</div>
        <br/>
          I am a project manager (also a professional librarian) at the University of Texas at Austin.  I am currently working on a meta-search application for digital images which are currently owned/curated by a number of different departments in our College of Liberal Arts.  Individual departments may have from about 5000 - 15,000 images.  Some have associated metadata, but it is not all in digital form (e.g., a few notations on the   slide itself).<br /><br />I need to develop a classification scheme which will incorporate the richness of existing discipline-specific metadata and give direction to future cataloging efforts.  Up to this point, departments have simply cobbled together &quot;best guess&quot; schemes based on the materials (images) at hand. (E.g., this is a picture of a vase, lets make a subject heading Vase--Egyptian).<br /><br />My idea is to let each discipline develop their own dc dialect, comprised of qualifiers on certain Dublic Core elements.  For example, Middle Eastern Studies may have dc:creator.architect in which will be placed the name of the architect of a Mosque and dc:creator.patronfor the patron of a Mosque.  Likewise, the film department may have dc:creator.director and dc:creator.screenplay_author.  Dc:subject will be even more widely ranging (if/when a particular subject scheme such as LCSH is not followed) and will provide a rich metadata set for users wishing to search a specific discipline.  For the &quot;digital tourist&quot; a search over unqualified Dublin Core will simply ignore the qualifiers and retrieve, for instance, any images with a dc:creator equaling their search term.<br /><br />These &quot;dialects&quot; of Dublin Core qualifiers will be developed by scholars in each discipline.  The aim will be to provide a rich metadata framework while meeting the &quot;dumb-down&quot; principle that without qualifiers a search still gets useful results, but simply with more recall and less precision.<br /><br />My question: is this a valid take on the goals of the Dublin Core effort?  In many case we will not be using DCMI &quot;best practices&quot; qualifiers (although in some cases, such as dc:coverage, we certainly will), but rather developing unique sets of qualifiers.  Is this taking the aims of Dublin Core beyond their intended scope?<br /><br />Any other thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated.  Also, I would greatly appreciated the opportunity to speak with someone with experience and expertise in this area and any recommendations of who I might contact would be great.<br /><br />thanks much-<br />Peter Keane

	<p>
	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> Peter,<br /><br />I think your description of your scenario probably reflects a common challenge facing Dublin Core implementers - and it seems to me your approach to it is quite sound.<br /><br />It touches on a couple of important issues.<br /><br />1. the distinction between the metadata schema used internally to an application and the metadata which that application "exposes" to the "outside world"<br /><br />(I'm agnostic on whether that "exposure" is through result sets of searches or through some other mechanism like exporting/harvesting ). <br /><br />It is quite common for an application to use some richer metadata schema internally and then to map/transform that richer structure to "Simple Dublin Core" for use by external applications.<br /><br />It may be the case that that internal metadata schema was designed without any reference to the DCMES itself, or (as you suggest ) the internal metadata schema may be explicitly based on DC. Typically the mapping to Simple DC is much easier in the latter case because it involves a direct simplification/"dumb-down", rather than a more complex transformation.<br /><br />2. "Dialects" of Dublin Core<br /><br />Increasingly, implementers wish not only to document their internal metadata schemas, but to share metadata records conforming to these richer "dialects" between applications, and to ensure that their local refinements/extensions are "understood" by the recipient.<br /><br />Researchers have developed the idea of the "Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP )" to represent the practice you describe: using DC metadata terms (elements, element refinements, encoding schemes ) in association with terms either drawn from other metadata vocabularies or developed specifically for the purposes of the application. A DCAP often prescribes additional constraints on the obligation to use elements or on the encoding schemes to be deployed for their values.<br /><br />The key factor (which again you acknowledge ) is to ensure that the extensions you make in your dialect(s ) conform to the DC "grammatical principles" or meta-model. <br /><br />i.e. if you introduce a new property and describe it as an element refinement of dc:date, then if an application acts on that assertion "in good faith" and "dumbs-down" your metadata to Simple DC, the values that you have assigned to your property should be valid values for dc:date. <br /><br />So for example, while it would be quite reasonable for one of your dialects to introduce a property "updatingFrequency" which describes how often a resource is modified, and takes values like "monthly", "weekly" etc, it would _not_ be appropriate to describe that property as an element refinement of dc:date, because those values would not be appropriate as values of dc:date.<br /><br />For some further information on DC Application Profiles, see<br /><br /><a href="http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/index.asp?cat=1735" target=_BLANK>http://askdcmi.askvrd.org/index.asp?cat=1735</A><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cenorm.be/isss/cwa14855" target=_BLANK>http://www.cenorm.be/isss/cwa14855</A>/ <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston <p />

	 Palle Aagaard<br> <p /> Fiona,<br /><br />Perhaps you should rephrase your question including an example of your problem, because mayby I have misunderstood your question. <br /><br />But as a general help I can state the following about using DC. <br /><br />For each DC element in use (for your records ) you have to fill in the content of the elments. E.g for the element "DC.Title" you have to fill in the title of the resource. The same for e.g. "DC.Decription" where you fill in a description of the resource.<br /><br />How search engines later index and uses this kind of information (also free (or full ) text ) for later search and retrieval by users, is another problem whÃ­ch is solved by "the search engine people".<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Palle<br /> <br /><br /> <p />

	 Makx Dekkers<br>Managing Director, DCMI <p /> Defining exactly what is the turnaround time for "completion of a standard" is not straighforward. Looking at the process we went through with the Dublin Core Element Set v.1.1 (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dces</A>/ ), you could say that the process started at the first Dublin Core meeting in 1995 (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/workshops/dc1" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/workshops/dc1</A>/ ). As the International Standard ISO15836 was formally adopted in late 2003, the total process could be said to have taken eight years. However, it makes more sense to take the date of finalisation of version 1.0 as the starting date (September 1998 ). The definition of version 1.1 was finalised in July 1999, so less than one year later. NISO then started the process to move this to a US National Standard and published NISO Z39.85 in September 2001, two years after it was proposed; at that point, it was proposed for the fast-track procedure in ISO which led to publication of the ISO standard in late 2003, so another two years. The total process therefore took five years (one for DCMI, two for NISO and two for ISO ).<br />For the internal processes withing DCMI, it is our experience that new proposals (e.g. for refinements or additional elements ) take between six months and a year, but again this depends on what starting point you take. If you start counting when the proposal is written up for review and comment, then it would be up to a year; if you start when the initial idea is brought up, it could be two years depending on the complexity of the issue and the available resources. <p />

        <br/>
          I was looking over the DCMI Metadata Terms document on the website.  Can I use the qualifiers listed with any element that is also listed?  Our project would find it useful to have more granularity by doing this.  I have a table that shows this if you would like me to send it.<br /><br />Tammy Jones

	<p>
	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> Tammy,<br /><br />The term "qualifier" was used historically to refer to a set of terms that are now typically treated as two distinct classes of term: element refinements and encoding schemes.<br /><br /><br />1. Element refinements<br /><br />Elements and element refinements are both properties, and are used to make statements about resources of the form: <br /><br />resource - property - value<br /> <br />Element refinements are properties that are related to exactly one DC element, in such a way that they narrow the semantics of that element. Any statement made using an element refinement implies that the statement made using the corresponding element is also true. e.g. if I say<br /><br />myText dcterms:created "2004-05-14"<br /><br />I imply<br /><br />myText dc:date "2004-05-14"<br /><br />Or if I say<br /><br />myText dcterms:spatial "North America"<br /><br />I imply<br /><br />myText dc:coverage "North America"<br /><br />An element refinement is always associated with only one element, and that association is part of DCMI's definition of the element refinement. <br /><br />So, for element refinements, the answer to your question is that you can not associate the element refinement with another Dublin Core element.<br /><br /><br />2. Encoding schemes<br /><br />An encoding scheme provides more information about the value of an element or element refinement. So, for example, the use of dcterms:LCSH as an encoding scheme specifies that a value is a specific type of subject heading, one drawn from the LCSH. The use of dcterms:W3CDTF as an encoding scheme specifies that a string representing a date is encoded in a particular form, and can be interpreted according to a published set of rules.<br /><br />DCMI does recommend the use of these encoding schemes for the values of specific elements or element refinements. So dcterms:LCSH is recommended for use with dc:subject; dcterms:W3CDTF with dc:date (and its refinements ), and so on.<br /><br />In theory at least, you could use an encoding scheme with an element or refinement other than the one it was recommended for, without breaking the "data model" on which DC is based - though you would have to decide on a case by case basis whether it was useful to do so: an encoding scheme for language codes would make no sense applied to the value of dc:date, for example. And looking at the encoding schemes available, I'm not sure there are many cases where they are useful for values of an element other than those for which they are recommended.<br /><br />I'd also add a note of caution that it's worth bearing in mind that such associations between an encoding scheme and an element (or element refinement ) are typically prescribed by the context in which your metadata is being used. e.g. applications processing your metadata records may work on the basis that all your values for dc:subject are LCSH terms. In DCMI terminology, this would be described as working with a specific "Application Profile" of Dublin Core. So you'd need to make sure that applications using your metadata records were able to process the values you supplied.<br /> <br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston <p />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Carlos:<br /><br />It looks like you have some specialized research to do about forest management, and I'd suggest that you approach a local librarian for help with that.<br /><br />As for your metadata questions, you might look and see if there are other projects on the DCMI website that cover the subject area you're interested in (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/ ). There are a number of environmental projects that use Dublin Core, and you may be able to find information on their sites about how they're using it.<br /><br />If you determine that Dublin Core might meet your needs, there are a number of guidelines and XML schemas available (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/schemas" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/schemas</A>/ )<br /><br />Good luck with your project.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I'm wondering what the proper syntax is for a &lt;dc:identifier&gt; element that is a URI. My instinct is to write it as:<br /><br />&lt;dc:identifier&gt;http://www.example.net/some/uri&lt;/dc:identifier&gt;<br /><br />However, some of the examples in the Qualified Dublin Core in RDF/XML use this format:<br /><br />&lt;dc:identifier rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.example.net/some/uri&quot;  /&gt;<br /><br />My understanding is that by using rdf:resource, one is saying that the identifier is the resource at the URI, not the URI itself.<br /><br />But the URI qua URI is the actual identifier -- not whatever's identified by the resource.<br /><br />Am I misguided and incorrect? Does it matter? Which is the preferred format?

	<p>
	 Pete Johnston<br>Research Officer, UKOLN;Chair, DC Collection Description WG <p /> Evan,<br /><br />The Guidelines for Simple DC in RDF/XML [1] recommend that the URI of a resource is encoded using RDF/XML's "built-in" rdf:about mechanism, rather than using a dc:identifier property.<br /><br />So<br /><br /><rdf:Description rdf:about="<a href="http://my.org" target=_BLANK>http://my.org</A>/"><br /> <dc:title>My resource</dc:title><br /></rdf:Description><br /> <br />I think your understanding of the example (2.3.8.1 ) in the Qualified DC in RDF/XML document is basically correct - you are not misguided (and I think that example would benefit from some additional commentary because it is not clear that it is saying something rather different from the example above )<br /><br />i.e.<br /><br /><rdf:Description><br /> <dc:identifier rdf:resource="<a href="http://my.org" target=_BLANK>http://my.org</A>/"/><br /> <dc:title>My resource</dc:title><br /></rdf:Description><br /><br />The subject is a blank node, so this says, "There exists a resource, which has as identifier a second resource denoted by the URI <a href="http://my.org" target=_BLANK>http://my.org</A>/".<br /><br />I queried this myself recently and the example I was given was that of a person and their passport.<br /><br />As a person, I don't have a URI assigned to denote me. I do have a passport. That passport has a unique identifier that I could use as the basis of a URI. Using a pattern like the one above, I could make an RDF statement saying that my passport identifies me. e.g.<br /><br /><rdf:Description><br /> <dc:identifier rdf:resource="<a href="http://passports.gov.uk/1234567" target=_BLANK>http://passports.gov.uk/1234567</A>"/><br /> <rdf:type rdf:resource="<a href="http://somedomain/Person" target=_BLANK>http://somedomain/Person</A>"/><br /></rdf:Description><br /><br />The subject of that statement is a resource of type Person (me ). The object is my passport. My passport acts as an identifier for me, but that URI denotes my passport, not me.<br /><br />So, as for which is the preferred format, it depends exactly what you want to say. ;- )<br /><br />If your URI denotes your subject resource, then use the rdf:about approach. If your URI is really the URI of a second resource, and that second resource acts as an identifier for your subject, then use the convention of example 2.3.8.1 in the QDC in RDF/XML doc. <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston<br /><br />[1] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml</A>/<br />[2] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml</A>/ <p />

          I have two versions of a document -- the original in English and the translation in Spanish. For the English version it is clear that 'creator' is the author.

As you know, DC does not have an underlying rule base, like AACR2, to answer questions like this unambiguously. <br /><br />Clearly, for the translation you need to list both the original author and the translator. I suspect that if you use the author as creator for both the original and the translation, with the translator as a Contributor on the translated version, you'll be taking the path that most implementors would choose.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

	 Pete Johnston<br>Research Officer, UKOLN;Chair, DC Collection Description WG <p /> We have found that some validating parsers do throw errors when processing the complexTypes in dcterms.xsd based on the SimpleLiteral type. However, based on comments on the XMLSchema-dev list and our testing with some of the major parsers such as XSV and MSXML, we felt that this usage was correct. See Appendix A of the Notes at<br /> <br /><a href="http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/02/notes" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/qdc/2003/04/<BR>02/notes</a>/ <br /><br />for more details.<br /><br />The major rationale for defining the SimpleLiteral type as we did was for maximum flexibility. We expected implementors to be able both to extend and restrict this type to meet their own needs. <br /><br />If you knew you would never need/want to extend the SimpleLiteral to allow child elements, you could simplify the schemas by taking a copy and changing the SimpleLiteral type in dc.xsd to a simpleContent model something like:<br /><br /><xs:complexType name="SimpleLiteral"><br /> <xs:simpleContent><br /> <xs:extension base="xs:anySimpleType"><br /> <xs:attribute ref="xml:lang" use="optional"/><br /> </xs:extension><br /> </xs:simpleContent><br /></xs:complexType><br /><br />Regards<br />Pete Johnston <p />

          I would like to know how to use the DC for videos' description in combination with Nordic Template. More specifically, I would like to know how to add in the Nordic Template the DCMI Qualifiers or if there is another template only for videos.<br /><br />Thank you in advance.<br />

	 Palle Aagaard<br> <p /> Dear Maria Gavrili,<br /><br />When using metadata connected to information you always have to define what "problem" you will solve when using the metadata. Is it resource (information ) discovery, is it resource (information ) workflow, is it describing the information etc. Dublin Core is for resource discovery, so if the "problem" you will solve is retrieval of videos you can use Dublin Core - nevertheless you maybe will need more metadata elements for describing videos.<br /><br />Regarding the Nordic template. This template produces DC metadata in lines with a correct syntax. If you will add the qualifiers you must take these lines and add the qualifieres with the correct syntx by hand.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Palle Aagaard <br /><br /> <p />

          Dear Sir or Madam,<br /><br />my company plans to implement Dublin Core in its websites. Nevertheless we are still unsure about the use that will result. I'd like you to answer the following questions:<br /><br />1) Do all search engines in the internet know and use the Dublin core information? Or is it possible that many search engines did not implement these standarts?<br /><br />2) As we found out it is possible to put all the meta files in a link. Does this bring any advantages i.e. for the speed (loading time) of the website?<br /><br />I'd like to thank you in advance and hope you can answer my questions asap.<br /><br />With best regards,<br /><br />Christian Schiel<br />SPC GmbH Berlin

        <br/>
          My library is starting a project in conjunction with our local historical society that entails digitizing and organizing local historical photos.  My co-workers and I believe that we should catalog these photos as we digitize but how to start?  We are sure Dublin-Core is the way to go but how do we submit a request to our library for purchase?  I cannot find any information on your website about how to obtain Dublin-Core or how much it costs?  I will re-look at the FAQ's concerning storage because that is one of my other questions and I believe that was already addressed on this site.  Lastly, as we don't want to slow down the project TOO much, is there a &quot;generic&quot; database (e.g. Access) into which we can start cataloging that will dump into Dublin-Core technology?  I imagine it will take some time to go through all the channels in our library before we can take advantage of Dublin-Core.<br />Any advice you give me would be of great help.<br />Thank you very much.<br />Karen

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Many libraries have extensive collections of maps. Those that provide DC interfaces to their catalogues will normally use dc:coverage to indicate the spatial extent of the map. <br /><br />The value of the dc:coverage can use the dcmi Box encoding to record the extreme values of the area. <br /><br />"Digitised" maps: if they merely represent a pre-existing mapsheet, then these are just a different manifestation of the map, and most of the metadata would be the same. However, many jurisdictions are now managing most of their geospatial data in digital form throughout. In this context "mapsheet" is becoming obsolete, since the information is often not stored this way. Mapsheet products are often still available, and dc:coverage should be used, as discussed above. <br /><br />Simon Cox<br />Commonweath Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation, Australia <p />

          How can I use DCM tags in my project? What steps I have to follow to implement the same?

	 Stuart Sutton<br>Professor in the Information School. Member of the DCMI Usage Board and the DCMI Advisory Board. Co-Chair of the DC-Education Working Group. <p /> Your question is really rather complex in that it has a number of sub-questions that must be asked (or additional information provided ) about your project before a full answer can be given. However, off the top, you should note that if the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES ) meets your project needs, you are perfectly free to develop "tags" using it. <br /><br />(1 ) Semantics and sufficiency: First, you need to make sure that the kinds of metadata descriptions your project needs can be sufficiently handled by the DCMES. If the answer is that there is a good match with the semantics (meaning ) of the DCMES and your project needs, you are in good shape with this key question. I say it is key in the sense that to say that your metadata is DCMES metadata, you need to adhere to the meanings as they have been defined. See <a href="<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/overview/">Overview" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/usage/documents/overview/<BR>">Overview</a> of Documentation for DCMI Metadata Terms</a> as the source for links to official explanations of the "meanings" or semantics of the DCMES.<br /><br />(2 ) Best practices: The benefits of having metadata at all can be enjoyed <b>only</b> if the metadata created is relatively consistent in quality and content. As a result, every project should develop a set of "best practices" to help those that will be creating the metadata to do so in useful ways. The DCMI has developed an excellent set of general "best practices" called <a href="<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/">Using" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/<BR>">Using</a> Dublin Core</a> that can be used "as is" or can be extended to meet the particular needs of your project.<br /><br />(3 ) Syntactic binding: The DCMES defines a set of elements and element refinements (element qualifiers ) and their associated meanings (semantics ). It does <b>not</b> require that each metadata record be syntactically bound (i.e., encoded ) in any particular way. That decision is dependent on where and how your project's metadata will used. As a result, DCMI does not say that you have to syntactically bind your metadata as HTML, or XML, or XML/RDF (<a href="<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource</A> Description Framework</a> ) tags. That decision is up to you and to your technical people depending on project needs.<br /><br />(4 ) Metadata generation tools. Finally, you have to create your metadata and store it in a metadata repository where it can be used by your project (and, perhaps, be harvested for use in other projects ). The best place to start looking for tools to generate metadata and to store it and make it accessible is the DCMI <a href="<a href="http://dublincore.org/tools/">Tools" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/tools/">Tools</A> and Software</a> page.<br /><br />In the end, each of these four topics will probably trigger additional questions when you begin to drill down into them. But, this should get you started thinking about the "how" of DCMES use in your project.<br /><br />Best of luck with your project! <p />

          Hello,<br /><br />I'm looking for a tool that will do the following:<br /><br />OCR a tiff and create a searchable PDF (&quot;PDF Formatted Text and Graphics&quot;);<br />Interrogate a database and load the data into the PDF as XML metadata;<br />Store the PDF in a file system structure based on simple rules (eg. department code export goes into export folder); and<br />Delete the tiff and data from the database and Tiff store (optional);<br />Support an incoming stream and an outgoing stream (FAXin &amp; FAXout); and<br />Allow management of metadata over time (editing and writing access log info to the metadata).<br /><br />This will allow me to generate a store of achievable objects that are discrete in themselves and not tied to a database or proprietary browser.<br /><br />Regards,<br /> <br />Mike Smith<br />IT Manager<br /> <br />T &amp; R Pastoral Pty.

	Thomax,I don't think you can take the approach you suggest in RDF/XML. The RDF/XML syntax is designed to be a serialisation of an RDF graph, a set of RDF triples: when an RDF/XML document is parsed the components of the XML tree are mapped to parts of the RDF graph as described in the RDF/XML syntax specification [1].So the XML elements in your RDF/XML document are interpreted as what RDF/XML calls "node elements" or "property elements" e.g. the XML element rdf:Description is a node element and corresponds to a node in the RDF graph; the XML elements dc:publisher. dc:identifier (etc ) are property elements and correspond to arcs in the graph. But your use of a "type" XML attribute doesn't fit the RDF/XML language.  To represent a triple using the property <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative</A> in RDF/XML, you need a corresponding property element i.e.<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns</A>#" xmlns:dc="<a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"xmlns:dcterms="http:/<BR>/purl.org/dc/terms</a>/"> <rdf:Description> <dcterms:alternative>alternative title</dcterms:alternative></rdf:Description> </rdf:RDF>Similarly for your non-DCMI terms, you need to assign URIrefs for those properties and use appropriate XML elements to represent them<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns</A>#" xmlns:dc="<a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"xmlns:your="http://your.org/terms" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"xmlns:your="http:/<BR>/your.org/terms</a>/"> <rdf:Description> <your:digitized>2004-01-29T13:54:18Z</your:digitized></rdf:Description> </rdf:RDF>The W3C provides a Web-based validation service for RDF/XML, which you may find useful [2]Are you sure you want to use RDF/XML? DCMI also provides a convention for encoding DC metadata in XML - though it adopts similar conventions to RDF/XML and would require the use of distinct XML elements for each property. [3]In using a type attribute as you do, you are really creating your own XML format - which is OK as far as your own application is concerned, but other applications will not interpret it as you expect.Pete[1] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar</A>/ [2] <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/[3" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/[3</A>] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines</a>/

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> I think that efforts on implementing/realising the Warwick Framework effectively shifted to the W3C's work on the Resource Description Framework (RDF ) family of specifications and the Semantic Web activity.<br /><br />Although more recent documents on RDF don't reference the Warwick Framework, there are a number of earlier references that describe RDF as an "instantiation of the Warwick Framework on the Web" or at least acknowledge the influence of WF on RDF.<br /><br />See for example<br /><br /><a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue15/events/stakis.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue15/events/stakis.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.lib.helsinki.fi/meta/oclc/sld017.htm" target=_BLANK>http://www.lib.helsinki.fi/meta/oclc/sld017.htm</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/talks/www7/tutorial/part1/sld047.htm" target=_BLANK>http://www.w3.org/People/EM/talks/www7/tutorial/<BR>part1/sld047.htm</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/interop-focus/presentations/cimi/taiwan/day2/iap-html/sld046.htm" target=_BLANK>http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/interop-focus/presentations/<BR>cimi/taiwan/day2/iap-html/sld046.htm</a><br /> <br /><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may98/miller/05miller.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may98/miller/05miller.html</a><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston <p />

	 Stuart Sutton<br>Professor in the Information School. Member of the DCMI Usage Board and the DCMI Advisory Board. Co-Chair of the DC-Education Working Group. <p /> NOTE: This answer is from an email exchange posted to the DC-Corporate and combines responses from Stuart Sutton and Thomas Baker.<br /><br />[Stuart Sutton]<br />"Erin, 'Audience' indeed has the DCMI status of recommendation and is equal in that sense with any of the original 15 DC elements. While it appears in the same namespace as the refinements, it is nevertheless what I consider a top-level DC element since it is not a refinement of any other element. The 'Audience' element was first put forward by the DC-Education Working Group (which I co-chair ) and was granted recommended status by the Usage Board on 5/21/2001. While there are various logical explanations for why this element appears in the same namespace as the refinements and not in the one with the original 15 elements, *none* of those explanations dispel the confusion created by the fact that the namespaces are different. So, no matter what machinations we go through to explain and to distinguish ... bottom line, 'Audience' is the 16th element and may be used as such with the full blessing of DCMI (as far as I can tell ). That is not to say that some legitimate uses may be limited by fiat or logic to the original 15."Stuart is correct. Logically speaking, there are top-level elements (the fifteen "core" elements plus Audience ) and elements that are also sub-properties of top-level elements ("element refinements" ). There are historical reasons for this particular terminology on which one could elaborate, but Stuart is quite right to get to the bottom line."<br />[Stuart Sutton<br /><br />[Thomas Baker]<br />"That the URI for Audience (<a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/audience" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/terms/audience</A> )<br />has a different prefix than the URI for Title<br />(<a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title</A> ) is also due to historical reasons. As pioneers in the use of URIs to identify terms, DCMI was among the first to learn -- the hard way -- the dangers of hard-coding 'grammatical' and versioning information into a URI string -- which is why DCMI switched from using a prefix with the string 'elements/1.1'<br />to using a prefix with the generic string 'terms'. Here too, one could elaborate for pages...<br /><br />When Audience was approved, we considered calling Audience 'the sixteen element of the Dublin Core'. However, that implied a Dublin Core 1.2, which in turn suggested there would be a Dublin Core 1.3, 1.4, and so on. Whereas we found that people generally preferred the notion of a small set at the center which remains reliably stabile. The price we paid was this nagging seeming-inconsistency with regard to Audience."<br />[Thomas Baker]<br /><br /><br /> <p />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Jill:<br /><br />Do you want to locate the museum, or an artefact housed in a museum? If the former, then it is straightforward: dc:coverage is used to record<br />the spatio-temporal location of the item being described. So the dc:coverage element of the metadata set for the museum will indicate its location. <br /><br />If it is an artefact in the museum, then I guess dc:coverage should still indicate its *present* location, though museums may also choose to record other locations associated with the artefact as well in additional dc:coverage elements. <br /><br />The DCMI Agents Working Group (<a href="http://dublincore.org/groups/agents" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/groups/agents</A>/ ) is currently exploring the issues around the identification of people and organizations relevant to Dublin Core.

          When using dc:subject for the predicate of a triple is it wrong to supply a resource for the object?<br /> <br />For example if the subject(of the triple) is a book, a biography, and we use dc:subject for the predicate is it wrong to give the URI of a the person the book writes about as the value of the object? Triple:<br /> <br />&lt;bookURI&gt; &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/subject&gt; &lt;personURI&gt;<br /><br />Semantically this would seam to make sense. However, the guidelines for using dc:subject would suggest that this is not in keeping with the intention of dc:subject.

	 Thomas Baker<br> <p /> As described in the Introduction to <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms</A>, every term has a Name and a Label. The name is meant to be used in computing environments and read by machines and is therefore, by convention, a single string without spaces "isVersionOf". The Label, which is meant to be read by humans, does have spaces: "Is Version Of". <p />

        <br/>
          Hi,<br /><br />I'm currently working on outputting the contents of a metadata repository on www.tki.org.nz into qualified Dublin Core XML. We currently store the terms as refinements of an element (e.g. dc:creator.name) however by the looks of things there's no way to express this in valid qualified DC XML. I'm guessing the only alternative is to cut all these refinements down to basic DC elements? i.e. dc:creator.name &amp; dc:creator.contact both become dc:creator.<br /><br />I was also wondering how best to represent an ISBN contained in the dc:indentifer the only encoding scheme for identifer seems to be URI?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Tama

	 Andy Powell<br>UKOLN, University of Bath <p /> Yes, your refinements should be cut down to dc:creator if you want to use DCMI properties. Alternatively, you could define your own XML namespace and new properties within that namespace for tki:name and tki:contact - but that wouldn't be DCMI metadata.<br /><br />I would encode an ISBN as a URN as follows<br /><br /><dc:identifier xsi:type="dcterms:URI"><br />urn:isbn:12345-67890<br /></dc:identifier> <p />

        <br/>
          I'm a student in Library and Information Science at The Swedish School of Library and Information Science (SSLIS) at H&#195;ƒ&#194;&#182;gskolan i Bor&#195;ƒ&#194;&#165;s.<br /><br />Now I'm working on my master thesis, in which I intend to do some comparison of the framework from the IFLA study Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and Dublin Core. My aim is to be able to tell something (not everything) about the usefulness of Dublin Core as a bibliographic standard. <br /><br />I haven't yet really found out on what level these two projects meet - one being a &quot;conceptual model&quot; and the other one both being a metadata set with recommendations for expression in specific syntaxes and also having a formulated &quot;abstract model&quot; and close bindings to the RDF &quot;data model&quot;.<br /><br />I've found Michael Days early (1999) and very brief comparison of the data models and entity attributes of the two projects, and even though I guess he misinterprets FRBR as a data model (wich I've been told it is not) I think his approach is interesting.<br /><br />Now to the question ... Besides any general hints and advices on what I should read and where I can find more information, I want to know if there is any other ongoing project or more recent existing report that does a more throughout comparison/mapping between FRBR and DC?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Daniel:<br /><br />I don't really know of any reports or studies that address FRBR and DC. I would suspect that Dublin Core's "one-to-one" rule might make such a comparison similar to the one between apples and oranges. <br /><br />Part of the difficulty, I think, is that FRBR works so nicely in the arena of literary works, that we really wish it could apply so neatly elsewhere. I wish you luck with your thesis, and hope you'll tell us about it when it's completed.<br /><br />You might consider putting a note on the DC-General mailing list and seeing if others have any thoughts on the matter. It would be an interesting topic for discussion.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> Hello Paul,<br /><br />DCMI issues guidelines for expressing DC metadata in RDF/XML [1, 2], XML [3] and XHTML [4]. In [2], [3] and [4], there are examples that signal that a value for dc:subject uses a formal classification scheme (what DC calls an "encoding scheme" ).<br /><br />From your reference to RSS and Weblog entries, I'm assuming you are wishing to encode this in RSS?<br /><br />The RSS 1.0 spec uses RDF/XML syntax, so the MESH example in section 2.3.9 of [2] may be of particular interest. (In the RSS context it does not seem to me appropriate to introduce the UDDI category bag convention. )<br /><br />Although RSS 1.0 uses RDF/XML syntax, the use of Qualified Dublin Core metadata in RSS 1.0 in described in an RSS module [5]. The module provides only limited information (one example at the end of section 1 ) on the use of "encoding schemes". <br /><br />Although it suggests that in theory the RDF/XML conventions described in [2] could be applied, I'd sound a small note of caution that you may find that some RSS 1.0 tools may support only what the module calls the "simple content model", rather than the full RDF/XML syntax.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston<br /><br />[1] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml</A>/<br />[2] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml</A>/<br />[3] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines</a>/<br />[4] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html</A>/<br />[5] <a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/dcterms" target=_BLANK>http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/modules/dcterms</a>/<br /> <p />

        <br/>
          Greetings,<br /><br />I am Paul Kiel, Chief Architect of the HR-XML Consortium (a non-profit Consortium standards body for human resource data).  I am also a former librarian who is familiar with Dublin Core and some of the related metadata technologies.  I am writing because we have identified a need for Dublin Core within one of our HR transaction standards that is currently in development.  In looking at the DC web site, I see several XML Schemas that are very close to what we want.  We would like to use them (via XML Schema import) assuming the proper credit etc.<br /><br />My question has to do with officialness.  I see several schemas, but I am unable to determine if there is a final (meaning &quot;Recommendation&quot; status) version of the XML Schemas representing the Dublin Core.<br />I see several versions here:<br /><br />http://dublincore.org/schemas/xmls/<br /><br />Perhaps I am missing it, but I don't see the status of these schemas.  So to put is succinctly, I'm asking:<br /><br />1) Is/Are there a Recommendation status XML Schema(s)?<br />2) If not, are the schemas dated 2003-04-02 in the link about the most recent ones? <br />3) If so, are they considered stable or do you see changes coming to them in the foreseeable future?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your help.<br />Cheers,<br />Paul Kiel<br /><br /><br /><br />W.

	 Pete Johnston<br>Research Officer, UKOLN;Chair, DC Collection Description WG <p /> Paul,<br /><br />My understanding is that the XML Schemas do not have a formal status in the way that the human-readable documents published by DCMI do.<br /><br />Yes, for representing Qualified DC metadata, the schemas dated 2003-04-02 are the current versions. <br /><br />(There is a separate schema for Simple DC metadata only, which uses a different content model, of which the version of 2002-12-12 is the current version. )<br /><br />In terms of stability, the content of those schemas will not change. <br /><br />However, DCMI _may_ issue a _revised_ set of schemas to reflect two possible changes:<br /><br />(a ) changes in the DCMI metadata vocabularies. In particular, new terms are likely to be added to the "dcterms" vocabulary, and new XML element declarations will be added to the XML Schemas for the <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms" target=_BLANK>http://purl.org/dc/terms</A>/ namespace to reflect those updates;<br /><br />(b ) possible changes to the XML encoding conventions [1] to enhance their capacity to express all the features of DC metadata, particularly in the light of discussions on the DC Abstract Model [2]<br /><br />At the moment, there are no concrete plans for (b ) and I flag it only as a possibility to be aware of. The DCMI Usage Board regularly considers proposals for new metadata terms, so changes of type (a ) are quite likely in the medium term.<br /><br />But any changes would result in the issuing of a new set of schemas with URLs reflecting a datestamp.<br /><br />Regards<br />Pete Johnston<br /><br />[1] <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-xml-guidelines</a>/<br /><br />[2] <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/abstract-model" target=_BLANK>http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/abstract-model</a>/<br /> <p />

	 Thomas Baker<br> <p /> Dublin Core was originally designed for describing "information<br />resources" with attributes such as Title, Date, Creator,<br />Subject, and Format. It has long been recognized that<br />a fuzzy class of objects known as "agents" tend to have<br />different sorts of attributes, such as Address, Affiliation,<br />Title (in a different sense ), and Name. While Dublin Core<br />itself may be "adapted" to describe agents, it is often not<br />appropriate to do so. <br /><br />The fact that no "agent core" has yet emerged analogous<br />to Dublin Core is in part a reflection of the diversity of<br />requirements for such a core in the wide diversity of contexts<br />for which agents need to be described. With respect to the<br />description of projects in particular, the recent White Paper<br />"Describing Projects" by the DELOS Working Group on Project<br />Metadata provides a number of links to significant work in <br />this area. <br /><br /><a href="http://delos-noe.iei.pi.cnr.it/activities/standardizationforum/Projects.pdf" target=_BLANK>http://delos-noe.iei.pi.cnr.it/activities/standardizationforum/<BR>Projects.pdf</a> <p />

	 Thomas Baker<br> <p /> CEN, the European Committee for Standardization (or [C]omite'<br />[E]uropeen de [N]ormalisation ) is an organization in Brussels<br />founded in 1961 to develop and promote voluntary technical<br />standards that advance the goals of the European Union in a<br />diversity of areas such as trade, environmental protection, and<br />computer network interoperability.<br /><br />As Dublin Core is an important metadata standard in<br />the European Union, CEN sponsors the development of<br />Dublin-Core-related specifications in the context of<br />an ongoing "Workshop on Dublin Core Metadata" (see<br /><a href="http://www.cenorm.be/sh/mmi-dc" target=_BLANK>http://www.cenorm.be/sh/mmi-dc</A> ).<br /><br />The CEN Dublin Core Workshop is philosophically similar to<br />the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative itself inasmuch they<br />both mobilize the efforts of experts in mailing lists and<br />meetings that are open to interested members of the community.<br /><br />Organizationally, the CEN workshop and DCMI are entirely<br />separate. In practice, however, there is significant overlap<br />in membership between DCMI and the CEN workshop, and the<br />two organizations closely coordinate their complementary<br />standardization efforts.<br /> <p />

The DCMI element set can be used by anyone for any website. However, I should point out that the site you refer to has misused the Title element. Title should be used for the actual title of the html page you are describing.<br /><br />As to whether using DC Title and Subject will mean your page comes higher up in search results on commercial search engines then the answer, at the moment, is unfortunately not. None of the major public search engines like Yahoo! or Google make use of DC tags. <br /><br />cheers<br />Andrew Wilson <p />

        <br/>
          Is there a recommended practice for referring to a Name Authority (or several) in relation to the string literal in the value of DC.creator?<br /><br />For example, in a description of a book <br /><br />should we use in HTML<br /><br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.creator&quot;<br />      content=&quot;Iain M. Banks&quot;<br />&lt;/meta&gt;<br /><br />&lt;meta name=&quot;DC.creator&quot;<br />      scheme=&quot;LC&quot;<br />      content=&quot;Banks, Iain, 1954-&quot;<br />&lt;/meta&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;<br /><br />(In this example, the author uses two forms of his name for different genre, the middle M. for science fiction, general fiction without.)<br /><br />I imagine corporate names would have even more cases and complexities.<br /><br />Fred K.<br />Cebu City, Philippines<br />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Fred:<br /><br />This has long been an issue throughout the DC community, particularly for librarians, for whom this sort of thing has long been possible in MARC! <br /><br />At the moment, there is no simple way to do so, but discussions are continuing. Some of this discussion is occuring in the DC Agents Working Group, and some in the DC Architecture Working Group. Both groups have mailing lists that you can join (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/groups" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/groups</A>/ for the list of groups ).<br /><br />You may also want to take a look at the Draft Abstract Model (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/abstract-model" target=_BLANK>http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/abstract-model</a>/ ) now under discussion by the Architecture WG.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

          To whom it may concern,<br />I am currently working on a digital library project in Cold Fusion where I have to include Dublin Core Metadata.

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Jean:<br /><br />Apolgies for the delay in replying. I'll answer your questions in the order you asked them.<br /><br />1. Yes, DC metadata can certainly be generated dynamically from databases. Many projects do this. The generated metadata is only as good as the program that creates it, so be sure that the metadata your project generates is of good quality.<br /><br />2. I'm not entirely sure I understand this question, but let me take a stab at it. You seem to be asking "why bother?" if your database is accessible via your website's search engine. I think if this is all you want to do, it probably is unnecessary. However, once you look beyond your site, or you decide to provide other services besides search, having standard metadata can be a good investment. Not everyone will want to go through your site to discover your resources, and if you partner with others to provide services you'll not necessarily want to provide access to your database to accomplish that.<br /><br />3. I'm not sure you need to expose the metadata in your search results, but it can be helpful to do so, particularly if your search results display is brief. If you go to <a href="http://nsdl.org" target=_BLANK>http://nsdl.org</A> and do a search, notice that there is a "more info" button beside each result. If you click on that, you will see the metadata showing up beside the results. Users tell us that this helps them make decisions about which resources meet their needs.<br /><br />4. It works a lot of different ways, depending on the project. Take a look at the DCMI Projects page (<a href="http://dublincore.org/projects" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects</A>/ ) for other projects that might be similar to yours. You'll find that there are lots of different approaches to making metadata work.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I. Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

          When cataloging very large technical reports in pdf format, I would like to be able to record the number of pages. Would the Format.extent refinement be the proper place for number of pages, or is it only for file size (in kilobytes)?

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation;Chair, DCMI Collection Description WG <p /> The definition of the Extent refinement is sufficiently broad to include any measurement of the size or duration of a resource, so yes, it would be reasonable to use it to record the number of pages in a document. <br /><br />If you wish to record the size of the digital object also, it would be good practice to express these two values as two separate occurrences of the Extent refinement within a single description.<br /><br />Extent = "66 pages"<br />Extent = "999 kilobytes" <p />

        <br/>
          In the project European Music Navigator we are about to classify information on music. Information on scores, recordings, composers, events and so on from a lot of partners all over Europe will be assembled in an Internet portal with a search engine.<br /><br />To enhance the search result we would now like to make a content classification based on the metadata standard Dublin Core.<br /><br />However we need to add a new controlled vocabulary to Dublin Core as the existing ones do not fully support our needs. We would like to add in the HTML-code a meta tag consisting of the subject element combined with something like &lt;scheme=EMN&gt; <br /><br />My question is in what order this should be done. <br /><br />a) Is it suitable or not to start naming and using a scheme and then register it later with DCMI?<br /><br />b) Would it be better to register the scheme immediately even if we will add or refine parts of the controlled vocabulary later on, or<br /><br />c) Should we rather start using DC without expressing anything like &lt;Scheme=EMN&gt;.<br /><br />In addition I also wonder if the schemes EMN, EMNT and EMNG are still available?<br />

There is no requirement that you register schemes with DCMI before you use them, and by using it staright away you will encourage your users to think about subject classification right from the start of your implementation. I think you should go ahead and starty using your scheme immediately. You might like to register it with DCMI once you have a reasonably stable version of the scheme.<br /><br />As far as I know the scheme names EMN, EMNT, and EMNG are all available - they have not been registered with DCMI as scheme names. So they should be available for you to use as soon as you like.<br /><br />One thing I should add is that it would be very useful if you could establish a namespace for the scheme as soon as possible. Schemes ideally should be publicly accessible over the Web so they can be more widely seen and used, and setting up a namespace will establish your claim to the scheme name you wish to use.<br /><br />I hope this has been of some help.<br /><br />Cheers<br />Andrew Wilson<br /> <p />

          A DCSV scheme indicates that I can string together a list of labeled values.  For the element Creator, I would like to use the following structured value Scheme &quot;creator.lastname=Doe; creator.firstname=Jane; creator.role=transcriber; creator.dates=1920-2000&quot; when I am exchanging data with a third party.  My question is can I include creator.lastname, creator.firstname, creator.role and creator.dates as separate individual elements in my metadata scheme and then use XML (XSLT?) to concatenate the 4 individual elements into the string when I am transmitting the data?  Would the 4 individual elements be local tags because of the refinements I am using?

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Your proposed usage of DCSV is unlikely to be interoperable with anyone else - therefore I would advise against it. In particular, the 'role' is not an attribute of the creator, but gives the relationship between the creator and a particular resource. Therefore it should be modelled as an element refinement.<br /><br />In general, you can do what you like within the confines of your own application. It is only when exporting metadata to external systems that you need to get the modelling correct - but I'm not convinced that the model in your proposed usage of DCSV is the correct one. <p />

          In the DCMI document about string values, &quot;DCMI DCSV: A syntax for writing a list of labeled values in a text string&quot;, it gives the example &lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Contributor&quot; SCHEME=&quot;DCMIDCSV&quot; CONTENT=&quot;name.given=Eric; name.family=Miller; employer=OCLC; height=170 cm&quot;&gt;  I am a bit confused about this.  Doesn't the inclusion of employer and height information violate the One-to-one Principle since you are now describing the Contributor as well as the resource?  Also, doesn't the inclusion of information other than the person's name broaden the semantics of the element Contributor?

          Dear all,<br /><br />I work for the United Nations on a humanitarian information project called ReliefWeb. We are trying to develop a metadata system based on ISO 15836-2003 for cataloging project data.<br /><br />We are working with a selection of elements from the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. Most of these elements correspond quite logically with metadata fields in our current  data set. For other fields in our current set we are developing what might be called sub-elements. For a given document on ReliefWeb, we record, for example, a number of dates -- the date the document was created, the date it was published to our site, and subsequent dates when the document's metadata was updated or modified. We're under the impression that we can remain compliant with the DCM element even with our sub-elements: Date -&gt; Creation; Date -&gt; Publication; Date -&gt; Modification. (please correct us if we're wrong, of course)<br /><br />The problem pops up for fields that we cannot locate logically within the DCM element set. For example, we classify text documents with a descriptive term from a controlled vocabulary -- 'News', 'Press Releases', 'Situation Reports', etc. Is this a DCM element set 'Description', a 'Format', a 'Type' or, if not any of these, then what? If it is a 'Type', what is the appropriate sub-element? We could use Type -&gt; Text, but that doesn't refer to a descriptor used for categorization of data, which is our purpose for using such terms in the first place.<br /><br />It is quite possible that we have not grasped some fundamental metadata concepts. But in any event, we would certainly appreciate your feedback.<br /><br />Thanks and best regards,<br /><br />The ReliefWeb Team<br />http://www.reliefweb.int<br />

	 Pete Johnston<br>Technical Researcher, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Jeffrey,<br /><br />The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set provides 15 "elements" to describe the properties (characteristics, attributes ) of a resource. As the DCMES provides only 15 elements, the distinctions you can make between characteristics of your resource are limited: you can make only simple "statements" such as "this is a date of an event in the lifecycle of the resource I'm describing" (using dc:date ) or "this second resource is related (somehow! ) to the resource I'm describing".<br /><br />So the short answers to your two questions are:<br /><br />(i ) Using only the 15 elements of the DCMES, all the date fields you describe would provide values for the dc:date element - and using only the DCMES, a consumer of your DC description would not be able to distinguish between the date of creation, publication and modification. They are all simply "dates of events in the lifecycle of the resource".<br /><br />(ii ) The examples you cite for your "descriptor used for categorization of data" look to me like examples of values for dc:type. They describe (I think! ) "the nature or genre of the content of the resource". DCMI does provide a simple, high level "DCMI Type Vocabulary" (which, as you note, includes the term "Text" ), but you are not limited to using that Type Vocabulary and can use your own "local" vocabulary to provide values for dc:type. Having said that, you need to bear in mind what applications will be consuming your metadata and whether those applications are programmed to interpret your values as you expect. Especially if you are sharing your metadata with applications that may not have "built-in knowledge" of your "local" Type Vocabulary, it is considered good practice to include a term from the DCMI Type Vocabulary where possible. All DC metadata elements are repeatable (unless in the context of your application some additional constraints have been specified ), so you could include two occurrences of dc:type in each metadata description:<br /><br />dc:type = "Text"<br />dc:type = "Press Release"<br /><br />To answer your question slightly more fully, it's probably best to say a little bit about Dublin Core's concept of "qualification".<br /><br />DCMI provides two mechanisms that allow you to make more precise statements than are possible using only the 15 elements of the DCMES.<br /><br />Firstly, DCMI provides several "element refinements". Each element refinement is explicitly related to exactly one of the 15 DC elements. Just like the 15 elements, an element refinement describes a property of a resource, but it allows you to make a narrower, more precise statement e.g. there is a refinement "date created" (dcterms:created ), which refines dc:date and allows you to specify that this date is specifically the date of creation of the resource. It's very important to note that element refinements always provide a "narrowing" of the meaning of the element which they refine: central to this idea of refinement is the principle that any occurrence of an element refinement can be replaced by an occurrence of the element which it refines with no loss of meaning. A "date created" is always a "date"; an "abstract" is always a "description"; saying A "is part of" B is completely consistent with saying simply A "is related to" B.<br /><br />Secondly, DC defines several "encoding schemes". The use of an encoding scheme provides some additional information about the value of a DC metadata element (or element refinement ), and encoding schemes fall broadly into two classes: <br /><br />- vocabulary encoding schemes specify that a value is a term from a controled vocabulary. So for example, the specification of an encoding scheme might help a consumer of a DC description determine whether a dc:subject value "Jethro Tull" referred to the 17th century agriculturalist or to the 20th century progressive rock band. Your type vocabulary is an encoding scheme for dc:type.<br /><br />- syntax encoding schemes specify that a value is formatted in accordance with some set of rules, such as that a date has the form YYYY-MM-DD<br /><br />If should still be possible to use the value without the encoding scheme: if an application has no built-in knowledge of an encoding scheme, the value alone may still be useful to a human reader.<br /><br />The use of these two distinct mechanisms is often described generically as "qualification", leading to the notion of a "qualified Dublin Core" description that uses this larger, richer set of terms, as opposed to a "simple Dublin Core" description that uses only the 15 elements of the DCMES.<br /><br />In a "qualified Dublin Core" description, you could express your distinction between your different types of date using the element refinements, dcterms:created, dcterms:modified and dcterms:issued, and you could include an indication that your type values were drawn from a specific vocabulary encoding scheme. But this would only be useful if an application reading your metadata is programmed to interpret these terms. An application that is programmed to interpret only the 15 elements of the DCMES would not be able to interpret these other terms. <br /> <br />You've probably noticed that I've avoided using your term "sub-element" above, and this was deliberate. You may well find that term used in some documents related to DC, particularly older documents, but as a rule DCMI tends to avoid using it, in part because it does it does not clearly specify the nature of the relationship between "sub-element" and "element" and in part because it can be confused with the specific concept of element containment/nesting in XML documents.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Pete Johnston <p />

        <br/>
          Instead of Creator (with the full name as its content), can I split it into Creator.Surname and Creator.Firstname?  If I dumb-down the element names, then the contents won't make sense on their own e.g. Creator=Doe and Creator=Jane.  Can I call Creator.Surname and Creator.Firstname DC tags or are they local tags?  If I decide to use the two Creator fields, when I want share the data with another party, can I use XSLT to merge them into one field called Creator, which will then be a true DC element?  Or from the onset, in addition to Creator.Surname and Creator.Firstname should I also have a tag called just Creator and duplicate the full name in its contents (to ensure easy interoperability)?<br />

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Creator.Firstname and Creator.Surname are not valid element refinements. Why? Because, as you argue, they do not dumb-down correctly.<br /><br />You can, of course, choose to use these tags within your internal system - but you should combine them into a single dc:creator element when you expose your metadata to external systems. <p />

          I'm a web applications developer at the University of Minnesota Libraries.  I come from a computer science and RDBMS background.  Computer Science departments generally don't teach XML or deal with front-end semantics/markup, but instead emphasize back-end storage mechanics and data normalization.<br /><br />Have you built any sets of standards for people who are implementing a Dublin Core set of data in an RDBMS environment (field names, data types, primary keys, enforced volcabularies) and this sort of thing? Libraries have never gone down this route since MARC (hundreds of fields and subfields) is not &quot;doable&quot; in a normalized RDBMS.  But DC certainly is...  So I'm curious how DC might be implemented in an RDBMS, in terms of relationship, normalization, etc. (not merely field name semantics).  Thanks for any help!

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Paul:<br /><br />DC maps fairly well to a standard RDBMS. One way to do this is to relate each metadata value to a metadata 'name' in a table structure like this:<br /><br />Metadata_Names<br />(PK ) Name_ID (Integer )<br /> Element Name (String*50 )<br /> Refinement Name (String*50 )<br /> Scheme Name (String*50 )<br /><br />Metadata<br />(PK ) Metadata_ID (Integer )<br />(FK ) Name_ID (Integer )<br />(FK ) Vocabulary_ID (Integer ) OPTIONAL<br /> Value (Memo )<br /><br />In this scenario, controlled vocabulary values could be stored as regulated rather than related values in the Metadata table. If storage space was at a<br />premium or there was concern that controlled vocabularies might be revised over time, you could add another table for managing the vocabulary and add an additional foreign key to the metadata table (OPTIONAL above ), using it rather than the memo field when a controlled value was referenced.<br /><br />The Metadata_Names table will contain an entry for each possible combinationof element/refinement/encoding_scheme in qualified DC. There's an example<br />here:<br /><a href="http://repository.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?QualifiedDCTable" target=_BLANK>http://repository.comm.nsdl.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?<BR>QualifiedDCTable</a><br /><br />The resulting Metadata & Metadata_Names relationship can be viewed like this:<br /><a href="http://dev.nsdl.org/prs_web/SE_MREC.php?ID=288897" target=_BLANK>http://dev.nsdl.org/prs_web/SE_MREC.php?ID=288897</a> (note this is a temporary URL )<br /><br />Hope this answers your question.<br /><br />Jon Phipps<br />National Science Digital Library<br /><a href="http;//nsdl.org" target=_BLANK>http;//nsdl.org</A> <p />

        <br/>
          I would like to include the birth-death dates of a creator and the role that person plays in the creation of the item (e.g. author/illustrator/transcriber, etc.)  However, I am concerned about two things, namely, extending the semantics of the Creator tag, and the dumb-down principle.  If I use Creator.Role and Creator.Dates are these valid DC tags or have I broadened instead of refined the Creator element?  If they are valid DC tags, then when I try to share the data and the tags are dumbed-down, the content will not make sense (e.g. Creator=1940-2001).  If they are not valid, then is there another DC element I can use to store this info?

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Creator.Role and Creator.Dates are not valid DC element refinements. Why? Because, as you argue very clearly, they do not dumb-down correctly.<br /><br />The creator role can be encoded using an element refinement of dc:creator, for example my:illustrator. See the DC LIbraries proposed application profile for an example of the use of MARC relator codes as refinements of dc:contributor.<br /><br />Birth and death dates could be encoded, in an unstructured way, in the value string for dc:creator, using the kind of formatting used in name authority files, e.g.<br /><br />Andy Powell, 1960- <p />

          I am trying to use DC to describe images.  For each image record, I need to use metadata to describe both the image and the original (source of the image).  This means in many cases, I will need duplicate DC element terms but one which describes the image and one that describes the original.  E.g. Publisher.Digital and Publisher.Original.   Date.Created.Digital and Date.Created.Original.  The information on both the digital image and the original must be kept in the same record.<br /><br />Three questions:<br /><br />1.  Can I have three or four part element names (refer to above)?<br />2.  Am I going to get into a lot of trouble in terms of interoperability if I have to make many local refinements to the basic DC element names?  So far I have 109 metadata tags based on the 15 DC element names (I have used many refinements because I need to describe both the image and the original).<br />3.  I am concerned about the Dumb-Down Principle.  I need Publisher.Digital and Publisher.Original, but if both terms dumb-down to Publisher, then how do I retain the distinction between the Digital object and the original item.<br /><br />Thank you.

	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Denise,<br />I think your approach is wrong. The original image and the digitised image are separate resources. Therefore, they need to be described separately. Yes, there will be some repetition in the metadata records. You may choose to design your internal system (e.g. a relational database ) to remove the repetition, but at the point to expose your metadata to external services, you should generate separate metadata records, each with the full set of details in it.<br /><br />You may also choose to use dc:relation, or dc:source, to indicate the relation between the digital version of the image and the original image. <p />

          I'd like to store DC metadata using RDF on a webserver, separate from the resources themselves. I've seen the approach of adding a meta link to the actual HTML resource to indicate where the RDF file is stored. Is there a recommended way to store the metadata separate from the resource without adding a link to the metadata in the resource itself? E.g. if the resource is http://foo/bar.html the metadata would be stored in http://foo/bar.html.rdf?

          All DC literature refers to web (XML, HTML) applications.  Is there not also a corporate Enterprise Meta Data Warehouse application usage here?  but don't the users of large meta data repositories have the same retrieval challenges as web users?  If DC encoding brings efficiency to data retrieval on the web, should it not do the same for the repository?  Or inversely, would there be a reason for NOT implementing DC encoding for the repository?  I can see a quantity difference, but not a quality difference between retrieving from the web or retrieving from Oracle, you have the same challenges in argument construction.  Or is it precisely the huge quantity of web data that makes DC encoding practical -- that it would not be efficient in smaller environments?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> It is probably not the size of the project that determines whether Dublin Core is sensible, but rather the nature of the content to be described. DC description covers a wide range of material, but not all--some scientific data sets, for instance, are difficult to describe with DC. <br /><br />However, your point that any kind of data needs structure and definition is a correct one. The project I work on at present uses Oracle, with Qualified DC as its base, and surely there are others that use it similarly.<br /><br />Diane I. Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

You may choose to describe all images and files with DC metadata or only a selection (or none ). <br /><br />Many implementors manage their metadata separately from their resources or pages, using a database.

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Fabiana:<br /><br />It's not clear to me what your question is. <br /><br />The category of "sub-elements" is not currently used by Dublin Core. Instead, the concepts of two kinds of "qualifiers": "element refinements" and "encoding schemes" are now used.<br /><br />There is a new version of "Using Dublin Core" available now at the DCMI website (see: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide</A>/ ), with additional information on qualifiers.<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

        <br/>
          Bonjour, <br />(1st question)<br />I'd like to know what are the practical consequences for a controlled vocabulary to be registered as a DCMI encoding scheme. I guess that it is useful to know how some values for DC.Subject have been encoded and to encode this fact in an XML file, but it seems that no real authority control in a DC environment exists yet. Am I wrong ? Even the mere mapping between DC elements and MARC encoded headings is not possible. SO...<br />Maybe what I say is false and naive. In all cases, your answer will be useful for me.<br />(2nd question)<br />What are the procedure and the criteria for a vocabulary to be registered as an encoding scheme ?<br />Merci beaucoup,<br />Yann

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Yann:<br /><br />DCMI has been working on the problem of registering vocabularies for use with DC metadata for the past year or so. Although we have encountered many obstacles in our path, we anticipate a limited release of our registration system, focused on subject vocabularies, early in 2004.<br /><br />For the initial release, we will be looking to "owners" of the vocabularies to register, so it would be useful for you to make contact with those responsible for the vocabularies you're interested in having registered.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Diane I.

          I need some clarification between:<br />Relation.isPartOf and<br />Relation.isReferencedBy<br /><br />I want to be able to describe individual photographs and also the set of fifty photographs.  I'm intending to have separate metadata records for each photograph and one of the set.  I was thinking that<br />image1 Relation.IsPartOf mySet<br />mySet  Relation.HasPart  image1, image2, etc<br /><br />Is this correct, or would I use<br />Relation.isReferencedBy   and<br />Relation.References   ?<br /><br />I can see using the .isReferenceBy and .References for resources that make up a webpage for example.<br /><br />Am I near to the thinking that led to the definition of these terms?<br /><br />Thank you!

        <br/>
          Hello. In your &quot;Dublin Core Projects- Geographical List: Europe&quot; you provide a list of Dublin Core projects originating in countries whose first language is not English. Of those projects, however, only the Denmark projects explicitly mention that they use &quot;Danish&quot; Dublin Core. Do you know, or is there any way of finding out, whether any of the other projects use the **translations** to their own language of Dublin Core (listed in your translations page, e.g., French, German, Spanish), instead of working directly with original Dublin Core elements, i.e., in English? Thank you.

On the translations page <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/translations" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/resources/translations</A>/ Each language version is accompanied by the organization. You might try contacting the persons involved (I know that Guy Teasdale still maintains the French version. the only other suggestion I have would to follow the project links and look for the best practices that should link to the version of Dublin Core they are using. However, I think it would be useful to add the links to the project(s ) directly on the translation page. <br /><br />Mary Woodley <p />

Clearly one reason is that there is so much happening in the here and now, that it's difficult to consider a comprehensive history effort at the moment.<br /><br />However, probably the best place to look for references to documents that would be included in such a history is the Bibliography attached to "Using Dublin Core" (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/bibliography.shtml" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/bibliography.shtml</a> ).<br /><br />Good luck,<br />Diane I.

The best way is to determine which element(s ) you wish to refine and then determine how your refinement(s ) narrows or limits the semantics of the element(s ). You need to remember that refinements are specifically for narrowing the definition (semantics ) of the parent element. It is also important to remember that the refinement cannot duplicate the semantics of any other exisitng element or registered element refinement.<br /><br />The 'dumb-down' principle is an important part of the interoperability principles of the DCMI model and is intended to ensure that element values have meaning even when element refinements, encoding schemes and any other 'markup' is removed.<br /><br />cheers<br />Andrew Wilson <p />

	 Stuart Sutton<br>Professor in the Information School. Member of the DCMI Usage Board and the DCMI Advisory Board. Co-Chair of the DC-Education Working Group. <p /> Claudia, in defining the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES ), the DCMI community did not define any rules for encoding values. For example in defining the element 'creator', DCMI did not establish any rules to control the manner in which the value--i.e., the name of the creator--is encoded. Since AACR2 is solely a set of rules to control the content and structure of values entered in elements it is not possible for the DCMES to "replace" AACR2. In fact, there is nothing that says that AACR2 cannot be used as the set of rules to be followed where applicable in entering values into Dublin Core records. <p />

        <br/>
          Hello,<br /><br />I am digitizing several thousand photographs from an archival collection and using DC to enable access.  Each photograph has a unique identifier, but occasionally I want to describe a series of photographs using one Dublin Core record.  The question: is it appropriate to be using the photographic identifier as the DC.Identifier?  If so, should multiple identifiers use repeated DC.Identifier elements, or should I use a range or serialization in one DC.Identifier element (i.e. Nos. 57-88, or 1,2,3,7,19)?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Eli:<br /><br />It is certainly appropriate to use the photographic identifier as the DC Identifier, particularly if that is the only identifier you use.<br /><br />If you want to do a series of photographs in on DC record (a mini-collection, as it were ) I would recommend repeating the element, rather than using a range or series of numbers within one element iteration. This seems to me a safer strategy, given that there's no way to know what the future might hold for the metadata.<br /><br />Diane I. Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

        <br/>
          I found a document at http://www.imsglobal.org/metadata/mdinfov1p1.html that relates Dublin Core elements to some of the IEEE elements.  Do you provide a version of such information?  There is one mapping that I do not understand, and there are two Dublin Core elements that do not have matches according to IEEE, but I see where there would be a relationship.<br /><br />We are trying to support IEEE, SCORM, and Dublin Core, so I am interested in making sure I understand where relationships and equivalent elements exist.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for any information.

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Yes. Your new element will not be a DC element, so when you encode it you should make this clear. For example, in XHTML you might use something like this<br /><br /><meta name="MY.price" content="$50" /><br /><br />The same thing in XML would look like this<br /><br /><my:price>$50</my:price><br /><br />where the 'my' prefix has been correctly declared as an XML namespace. <p />

        <br/>
          Hello!  I'm trying to create a crosswalk to go between DC, MARC21, and fields that I've created for an image database of educational visual aids that were created by the New Deal agency, the WPA.  I've created a field called &quot;Production Place&quot; to refer to where the item was manufactured or published.  It seems like I would need a refinement of the element Publisher (I'm referring to organizations not individuals) but cannot seem to find an appropriate refinement that defines a place of production.  What would be your recommendation for what element and refinement I should use?<br /><br />Thanks very much!  <br /><br /><br />Paul Lefrak<br />Broward County Library

	<p>
	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> Place of publication is not a refinement of dc:publisher (because it would not dumb-down correctly - e.g. my:publicationPlace=England --> dc:publisher=England is not correct ).<br /><br />I'm not aware of any widely used element for this - so you may well have to invent your own.<br />However, creating a new element in this way will not be interoperable with other metadata applications.<br /><br />For example, in the BIBLINK project we created a new property called biblink:placePublication (see <a href="http://hosted.ukoln.ac.uk/biblink/wp8/fs/bc-semantics.html" target=_BLANK>http://hosted.ukoln.ac.uk/biblink/wp8/fs/bc-semantics.html</a> ). Note, BIBLINK is not an active project - therefore I wouldn't suggest re-use of this particular element.<br /> <p />

        <br/>
          My name is Bill Best and I work for the Community Media Association (CMA -<br />http://www.commedia.org.uk).  The CMA has  developed an online multimedia archive (http://showcase.commedia.org.uk) as part of the New Opportunities Fund Digitise project<br />(http://www.nof-digitise.org/).  Also we are members of a consortium of NGO's consisting principally of OneWorld (http://www.oneworld.net) and Amarc International (http://www.amarc.org) and we have attempted to define a metadata schema applicable to multimedia that is based on DC and the EBU core metadata set for radio archives (http://www.ebu.ch/tech_t3293.pdf).<br /><br />As a NOF (http://www.nof.org.uk) funded project, we have to be sure that we comply with the UK Government's guidelines on 'interoperability' as explained in the e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) now in Version 4<br />(http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/interoperability/egif_document.asp?docnum=534).<br /><br />The Framework prescribes the policies and technical specifications that will act as the foundation of the e-Government strategy and help get the UK online.  e-GIF Version 4 utilises market driven open standards to enable the seamless flow of information from back end systems to citizen and business, and between government organisations.  It is a well put-together set of standards that pulls in W3C (http://www.w3.org/), Accessibility<br />(http://www.w3.org/WAI/) and Dublin Core Metadata guidelines.  It is the view that all UK Government and Government- funded projects are all e-GIF compliant - some day.<br /><br />We would like to confirm with yourselves that our work on the Shared Online Media Archive metatdata set has not breached your Intellectual Property Notice (http://www.dublincore.org/about/copyright/#documentuse)  but if we have we would like to remedy this, in conjunction with yourselves,  as soon as possible.<br /><br />We have noticed that the EBU metadata set for radio has no copyright notices on it and we would like to know if it would be possible to make the SOMA metadata set available under GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#FDL).<br />We understand that this might not be possible as the DC metadata schema is copyrighted.<br /><br />It has been a very interesting learning experience so far working with the DC and EBU schemas and trying to come up with something similar that will work with archived audio and video media.<br /><br />I hope that you find out project interesting and that it can further developed and extended.<br /><br />Many thanks and best regards<br /><br />Bill Best<br />Community Media Association<br />http://www.commedia.org.uk

          I notice that in describing various DCMI documents that you often have a &quot;Document Status&quot; field, and yet this does not seem to be one of your basic elements.<br /><br />How can I best describe Document Status using Dublin Core (eg 'Draft','Available','Withdrawn','Superceded', and so on)?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> "Document status" is not a part of the Dublin Core element set, but is instead an administrative attribute internal to the workings of DCMI. You could think of it as a "local" controlled vocabulary, part of the administrative metadata that DCMI uses to make its documentation available to the outside world.<br /><br />For your purposes, you may choose to do the same sort of thing, but the specification for *how* you do it will be part of your local practice, outside or beside the Dublin Core description of your documents.<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"<br />Member, DC Usage Board and Advisory Board <p />

        <br/>
          We are not sure if we should provide our metadata in HTML or RDF, for our website. Which is a better option? What should be our criteria for choosing? Also, in HTML can we have all elements from DC except for &quot;description&quot; and &quot;keyword&quot; or is it better to repeat the information in &quot;description&quot; and in &quot;DC.Description&quot;?

	 Stuart Weibel<br>Convener of the DCMI workshop series and director of DCMI <p /> The choice of an encoding syntax remains one of the vexing design choices of current metadata deployment. The answer must reflect a combination of factors, including available expertise, nature and complexity of the application, and the nature of any peer-applications (if any ).<br /><br />The choices include HTML, XML, and RDF XML<br /><br />HTML is the easiest approach - metadata can be embedded directly within the resources if they are HTML, and are available for harvesting by web crawlers (this may or may not be an advantage ).<br />HTML is also the crudest encoding idiom, and will not easily support things like embedded namespaces that can facilitate the mixing and matching of different element sets.<br /><br />XML affords additional options that are intrinsically structurally richer. The Open Archive Initiative uses this approach, and conforming to their practices may increase the likelihood of future interoperability with other applications.<br /><br />RDF-XML is a 'dialect' of XML targetted towards declaring and reusing metadata vocabularies in a way that is intended to make it easier to extend metadata sets and mix them. The state of RDF still requires fairly sophisticated developers, and the result is that it is not as widely used as might be hoped. Risch Site Summaries (RSS ) is a syndication technology that is commonly found in Blogging systems, and which uses RDF. Looking at this flavor of application may help to refine your interests in the technology.<br /> <p />

        <br/>
          For an online digitized still photo library , is there a certain metadata element set, or proper classification scheme in which still photos are to be categorized? <br /><br />- How do you properly categorize still images for an online repository/library? <br /> 
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2003-07-16 15:42:00 by  Stuart Weibel</div>  
	<p>
	 Stuart Weibel<br>Convener of the DCMI workshop series and director of DCMI <p /> The Dublin Core is widely used as a metadata set for still images, and it can be used with or without a formal classification scheme. The Pictures Australia site <<a href="http://www.pictureaustralia.org" target=_BLANK>http://www.pictureaustralia.org</A>/> is an excellent example of such an application. <br /><br />The question of which (if any ) classification scheme to use is largely a local issue. The additional expertise necessary is likely to increase both the cost and the eventual usability of the collection. The decision of which scheme to select should be influenced by available expertise, the domain of the collection, and usage of similar schemes among peer applications (is the host library an LCSH house? DDC? Special domain with a specialized thesaurus available? ) <p />

        <br/>
          Hello,<br /><br />I come from the GIS world, where metadata is synonymous with spatial data metadata. I am trying to learn more about non-spatial metadata for a project I am working on, and am surprised that there is no mention of GIS, geographic or spatial data, or anything related at DCMI. What is the reason for this? Where should I go for cross-over info: spatial *and* non-spatial metadata?<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Daniel

	 Stuart Weibel<br>Convener of the DCMI workshop series and director of DCMI <p /> Hi Daniel,<br /><br />Thanks for your question. As it happens, there has been GIS-related interest in DC from the very beginning, but as is probably obvious, the specificity and detail needed in GIS metadata often go far beyond what one expects to find in DC. Bringing these areas closer together requires a modular metadata model that supports the cross-domain generality of Dublin Core while supporting the extensibility necessary to extend vocabularies into the more esoteric needs of a domain such as GIS.<br /><br />One source of expertise in this area can be found in the DC-Environmental special interest group [<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/groups/environ" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/groups/environ</A>/], a group focused on the application of DC to the environmental domain, but which has a strong element of GIS interest in it.<br /><br />Another approach worth exploring is to look at the DCMI Projects page and search or browse for projects with a strong GIS component. Again, the environmental domain and the science and technology domains offer several examples that may help you get a feel for what is being done.<br /> <p />

	 Palle Aagaard<br> <p /> Hi,<br /><br />First, this is not a Dublin Core specific question - as far as I can see. But nevertheless I will give you an answer to the best of my knowledge.<br /><br />I understand your question as a question about if there exist "switching languages" for translation (mapping ) between different subject vocabularies (keyword schemes or classification schemes )- or some common set of keyword vocabulary which belong to different vocabularies.<br /><br />Both approach will improve "subject search interoperability".<br /><br />I do not know of any official (official published by a well known editor ) keyword vocabularies which e.g can be considered as a switching language. But such vocabularies exists e.g. in some domain specific areas - to some degree. <br /><br />I will recommend a database search (library & information science ) - and perhaps also an Internet search.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Palle <br /> <p />

	<p>
	 Palle Aagaard<br> <p /> Hi,<br /><br />I understand your question as you have to describe the content of some slides. Your difficulties is how to describe the time-periods connected to the content of the slides. The time periods are not exact but something like "1850-1900" or "19th century".<br /><br />First, I will recommend the use of dc.coverage. Then I recommend you read " DCMI Period Encoding Scheme: specification of the limits of a time interval, and methods for encoding this in a text string" at <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-period</A>/ (Notice the warning about a perhaps obsolete guidance for syntax ). I think especially the examples, where time-periods are shown as free text, can have your interest. But again, the shown syntax can be obsolete, so I will recommend you also read the encoding guidelines via <a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/expressions" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/resources/expressions</A>/ and the scheme <a href="http://dublincore.org/2003/03/24/dcq#Period" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/2003/03/24/dcq#Period</A><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Palle<br /> <p />

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Darryl:<br /><br />At the moment, DCMI recommends a small number of subject schemes for use with Dublin Core metadata. These schemes are not maintained by DCMI, but are in fact maintained by other organizations. Examples are the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH ), maintained by the Library of Congress and the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC ), maintained by OCLC, Inc. (See <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-schemes" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/2002/10/06/current-schemes</a>/ for a list of currently valid Encoding Schemes ).<br /><br />DCMI is planning to have a method for registering other subject schemes for use with DC metadata sometime this fall. At that time, implementations or maintainers of thesauri will be able to register their subject schemes with DCMI and be able to use an unambiguous token with their metadata to express that scheme.<br /><br />As you may see from this explanation (I hope ), using DCMI subject schemes is considerably simpler (and more complicated ) than a simple script to a list maintained by DCMI.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          We're creating a digital collection of Victorian Trade Cards. We want to include an element for the geographic location of the company whose product is being advertised (creator). But we aren't sure where it might fit within the DC schema. The same company also typically produced the card (publisher). A refinement of the publisher element would seem to make the most sense. Any suggestions?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> TJ:<br /><br />Your question is an interesting one, and challenges the notion of "simple metadata" quite a bit!<br /><br />Let me try to explain what I mean: the items in your collection are the trade cards. You have determined that the company whose product is exposed in the cards is to be described as the creator. So far so good. But now you want to also include more information about the creator--in your case, the geographic location of the company. I can see the utility of this, but are you not now describing another resource, not the card at all, but the company?<br /><br />DC has something called the "one-to-one" rule, which basically says: "describe one thing at a time." Recognizing that this is sometimes insufficient, we have begun to reconsider something called Structured Values (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/28/dcmi-dcsv" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/07/28/dcmi-dcsv</a>/ but note that this document is currently under revision! ). <br /><br />I would note here that refinements of DC terms that are not "vetted" and approved by DC have the potential to create problems when you share your data, because such refinements are not represented in DC namespace. You could, of course, set up your own refinement, but if so, be careful that you express it properly in your instance data, with appropriate documentation for other implementors. <br /><br />Thanks for your question.<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core," and member, DC Usage Board and Advisory Board <p />

	 Makx Dekkers<br>Managing Director, DCMI <p /> <br />CORES is a project funded under the Information Society Programme of the European Commission and runs from April 2002 through June 2003. It has two main objectives. Firstly, it organized a Metadata Standards Interoperability Forum resulting in an agreement among metadata standards initiatives -- GILS, ONIX, DOI, CERIF, IEEE/LOM, MARC21, and DCMI -- to identify metadata elements using the common syntax of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs, RFC 2396 ). Secondly, it established and maintained a metadata registry, building on prior work in the related projects SCHEMAS and DESIRE. <br /><br />The Interoperability Forum involved DCMI as a participant. The resulting CORES Resolution records an agreement among standards communities on principles very much in line with those of DCMI; an article in the July issue of D-Lib Magazine will increase awareness of this important agreement.<br /><br />The Registry activity based its data model largely on that of Dublin Core, drawing on software developed in a UK project (MEG ), but with a scope broader than Dublin Core alone.<br /><br />Related links:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cores-eu.net" target=_BLANK>http://www.cores-eu.net</A>/<br /><a href="http://www.cores-eu.net/interoperability" target=_BLANK>http://www.cores-eu.net/interoperability</A>/<br /><a href="http://www.cores-eu.net/registry" target=_BLANK>http://www.cores-eu.net/registry</A>/<br /><a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july03" target=_BLANK>http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july03</A>/<br /> <p />

        <div class="h4">Question asked on: 2003-05-23 00:00:00 by Guy</div>
        <br/>
          Hi,<br /><br />I suppose this is a question that might have been addressed before, but I'd like to know what would be the DCMI recommendation on using Creator or Publisher when we're talking about a new media departement in a company. <br /><br />For exemple, Radio-Canada, the public broadcaster is developing and hosting web pages. Should we indicate it as the publisher or creator of the ressource or both, and if we want to granularize the department responsible for creation of the resource (New Media), is it possible to include on the same value RAdio-Canada, New Media, either as a creator or publisher ?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Guy St-Onge<br />projects coordinator<br />Radio-Canada.ca<br />

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Guy:<br /><br />It seems to me that the clearest thing would be to look carefully at the role these departments are playing in the creation and dissemination of the resources, and how those roles relate to the DC elements CREATOR and PUBLISHER. <br /><br />If the departments are responsible for the intellectual content of the resource, they should clearly be listed as CREATOR. If their role is primarily dissemination, then PUBLISHER is probably more appropriate. As a general rule, people are more likely to be creators and organizations more likely to be publishers, but that's not always true, as we know.<br /><br />As for repeating the name of the department or organization in both places, this may be confusing unless both roles are played by the same organization. The more you "default" information in either place, the less useful each element becomes to a user. Keep in mind that most indexing will lump them together in any case (on the theory that the user will not necessarily make the same distinctions that the cataloger did ), so repetition will tend to create a lot of "false hits" in the long run.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          I have a basic understanding of using DC elements to tag web pages.  However, many web sites are based on an underlying database and web pages are created on the fly.  Can you refer me to DC documentation that applies to this?
	  <br/>
	  <br/>
	<div class="h4">Response given on: 2003-06-02 16:18:00 by  ASKDCMI Administrator</div>  
	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Mary:<br /><br />It's true that for many websites these days, the CONTENT of the site is maintained in a database, and the pages are created dynamically. This makes the option of including metadata on the webpages themselves impossible.<br /><br />However, the metadata can also be managed in a database, linked to the content in some way. This is essentially the model that libraries have always used--metadata and content in separate places, linked: in the old days via a call number, now more likely by a URL or other identifier.<br /><br />The DCMI documentation doesn't really deal with issues like this in any depth, but I think once the concept is understood, you'll be able to go on from there.<br /><br />Diane I.

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Todd:<br /><br />If I understand what you're asking, I think you're confusing the function of Dublin Core with other web functionality. The Dublin Core Element set provides the semantics to describe resources--what you do with those metadata descriptions is another sort of problem altogether.<br /><br />The search functions you describe seem fairly standard, but you would need to look at web applications (which I'm not in any way an expert on ) to determine your needs. <br /><br />However, I do think that if you want to provide the search functionality you describe, having good metadata will be important.<br /><br />Diane I.

        <br/>
          Diane,<br /><br />Many thanks for your very helpful answers.<br /><br />You said:<br />&quot;The DCMI Usage Board, which is charged with reviewing<br />proposals for new semantics, will undoubtedly be adding new qualifiers in<br />future, though probably not many. This is a quite different process than<br />IMS or LOM, I believe, and although there is an agreement about core<br />elements (the original 15) ...&quot;<br /><br />OOPS, I just checked my list and found only 12 ?<br /><br />&#194;&#167;	isVersionOf<br />&#194;&#167;	hasVersion<br />&#194;&#167;	isReplacedBy<br />&#194;&#167;	replaces<br />&#194;&#167;	isRequiredBy<br />&#194;&#167;	requires<br />&#194;&#167;	isPartOf<br />&#194;&#167;	hasPart<br />&#194;&#167;	isReferencedBy<br />&#194;&#167;	references<br />&#194;&#167;	isFormatOf<br />&#194;&#167;	hasFormat,<br /><br />and, added more recently,<br /><br />conformsTo ?<br /><br />You also said:<br />&quot;It's entirely possible that some organizations have<br />'customized' the qualifiers, in fact, so long as they do so in a<br />manner consistent with good practices regarding schemas and namespaces,<br />there should be no problem regarding interoperability in general.&quot;<br />[snip]<br />&quot;So far as I know (and I<br />should) there is no qualifier 'isBasedOn' (the definitive list is at<br />http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/).&quot;<br /><br />Indeed, the &quot;isBasedOn&quot; qualifier is not from DCMI but it may have been added by IMS.<br /><br />You also said:<br />&quot;(4) I'm not sure I understand your question here, but let me try and<br />build out from your scenario. If  Resource 1 cites another resource (which<br />may or may not be listed as a Reference within the publication), it could<br />be included as a References relationship on the metadata, if you so<br />choose. You could then, if you wished, make a reciprocal entry on the<br />metadata for the referenced resource, as isReferencedBy. Whether or not<br />you do so would likely be based on the needs of your implementation and<br />whether the costs of enriching your metadata in that way made sense in<br />your context.&quot;<br /><br />The last question concentrated on the fact when to use REQUIRES and when REFERENCES:<br />It you make a REFERence to something, it should be present, thus it is REQUIRED to be there?<br /><br /><br />Many thanks again and kind regards,<br />Gerhard<br /><br />PS I just referenced your Web page &quot;Using Dublin Core&quot; in my paper.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />Prof. Dr. Gerhard Knolmayer<br />Institute of Information Systems<br />University of Bern<br />Engehaldenstrasse 8<br />CH 3012 Bern<br />Tel: ++41.31.631.3809 (Secr.)<br />Fax: ++41.31.631.4682<br />http://www.iwi.unibe.ch/<br />----------------------------------- <br />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Dr. Knolmayer<br /><br />1. By the "original 15, I was referring to the ELEMENTS defined at: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dces</A>/ -- not refinements for the element RELATION. <br /><br />2. If IMS has defined 'isBasedOn' that should be perfectly usable, SO LONG AS the schema correctly attributes that refinement to an IMS namespace, not Dublin Core.<br /><br />3. All Dublin Core elements and element refinements are optional and repeatable. Any requirements to include references come from elsewhere--Dublin Core does not make those kinds of requirements. Be careful as you go forward with your implementation that Dublin Core is at heart a very simple metadata set, without the sorts of internal structure you might be used to within IMS.<br /><br />Thanks for referring to "Using Dublin Core" in your paper. <br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"<br />Member, DCMI Usage and Advisory Boards <p />

        <br/>
          I'm probably missing something but cannot work out the intended cardinalities of the terms defined.<br /><br />My question is:<br /><br />What does the DCMI recommend or intend as the cardinalities of the terms for a single catalogue entry?<br /><br />It is fairly clear to me that there may be many contributors.<br />It isn't so clear to me that the intention is to have only one or possibly many creators.<br />I can work it out for contributor because the natural understanding of the term leads me to believe there may be more than one.<br />I'm also a tiny bit confused because I think the creators are contributors. They are preeminent contributors.<br />Is it intended that I do not repeat the creator as a contributor?<br />I do admire the intent of flexibility and flexibly given in exactly what the terms are intended to signify.<br />If the specifications were too prescriptive they won't apply widely and existing catalogues won't fit we in to the scheme.<br />Both of these are undesirables.<br />I'm using 'intended' to represent what the DCMI purposes the terms for. You could just as easily say 'recommended'.<br />

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> All DC elements are both optional and repeatable. So, within a single catalogue entry you may repeat both creator and contributor as many times as you like.<br /><br />There has been an ongoing discussion over the last year or so about whether creator is an 'element refinement' of contributor, i.e. whether all creators are automatically also contributors. This discussion has not yet been resolved. However, some implementers are choosing to use only the contributor element rather than using both creator and contributor, i.e. they are not distinguishing those parties that were 'primarily responsible' for contributing to the resource.<br /><br />If you choose to use both creator and contributor, do *not* repeat each creator as a contributor. <p />

        <br/>
          At present, I am directing a seminar in which we want to implement the relation attributes between e-learning objects (=resources) as defined in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is difficult to find answers to the following questions:<br /><br />(1)	Why is a certain type of relation always defined in both directions? This would make sense if there could be asymmetrical relations but we cannot imagine such cases.<br />(2)	Is the 2000 version of qualifiers on relations the last version? Is it different from LOM or IMS? Several organizations have &quot;customized&quot; the original set of qualifiers?<br />(3)	We have many problems in finding good examples of the qualifiers defined and in distinguishing them. For instance, can we say that<br /><br />Requires is stronger than references?<br />Requires in stronger than IsBasedOn?<br />References is stronger than IsBasedOn?<br /><br />Would it make sense to define only the strongest qualifier because the weaker ones hold automatically?<br /><br />(4)	Let us assume that resource 1 cites (=makes reference) to a book. The short form of the citation in resource 1 requires that we list the book on the reference section. Would the Dublin Core describe that situation by &quot;requires&quot; or by &quot;is referenced by&quot;?<br /><br />Many thanks<br />Gerhard

	<p>
	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Gerhard:<br /><br />You've asked some very good questions. Let me take them as you've organized them:<br /><br />(1 ) Not all relation refinements are defined in both directionsâ€”conformsTo, for instance, is unidirectional. It is also not required that both directions be utilized, but since there were situations when we could conceive that someone would want to use reciprocal relationships, we made it possible to do so.<br />(2 ) There is not really any such animal as "the 2000 version of the qualifiers." The DCMI Usage Board, which is charged with reviewing proposals for new semantics, will undoubtedly be adding new qualifiers in future, though probably not many. This is a quite different process than IMS or LOM, I believe, and although there is an agreement about core elements (the original 15 ) used in common, that does not extend to qualifiers. It's entirely possible that some organizations have "customized" the qualifiersâ€”in fact, so long as they do so in a manner consistent with good practices regarding schemas and namespaces, there should be no problem regarding interoperability in general.<br />(3 ) "Using Dublin Core" is at present being updated, and more examples should be available when that process is complete, but for the moment you are correct that good examples do not exist. So far as I know (and I should ) there is no qualifier "isBasedOn" (the definitive list is at <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms</A>/ ). The Relation refinements are not necessarily ranked as stronger or weakerâ€”each has a specific definition which should help determine where it might be effective. Your suggestion that only the "stronger" be defined really does not work well within a relatively simple set of terms like Dublin Core. Those sorts of assumptions would require a fairly sophisticated common understanding that I don't think exists presently, and would be difficult to build within the diverse community that Dublin Core serves.<br />(4 ) I'm not sure I understand your question here, but let me try and build out from your scenario. If Resource 1 cites another resource (which may or may not be listed as a Reference within the publication ), it could be included as a References relationship on the metadata, if you so choose. You could then, if you wished, make a reciprocal entry on the metadata for the referenced resource, as isReferencedBy. Whether or not you do so would likely be based on the needs of your implementation and whether the costs of enriching your metadata in that way made sense in your context.<br /><br />Good luck with your seminar,<br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"<br />Member, DCMI Usage Board and Advisory Board<br /> <p />

          Forgive me is this seems a basic question. I'm new to the learning objects arena and am involved in a  research project where we're thinking of applying LOM. However, I would like to ask: can you please explain the relationship between the Dublin COre metadata activity and LOM. Are you working together? Or are your agendas completely separate? PLease point me to appropriate URLs if need be so I can get a better understanding of this.<br />Many thanks. Look forward to your reply.<br />Shirley<br />

	 Andy Powell<br>Head of Development, Eduserv Foundation <p /> DCMI provides a relatively simple set of metadata elements for describing 'resources', where resources is interpreted very widely and includes Internet resources, books, journals, images, movies, sound files, datasets, museum artefacts and so on. The intention of DC metadata is to support resource discovery (particularly in the context of Internet-based services ).<br /><br />IEEE LOM is a metadata specification that primarily focuses on the description of learning objects - and its intention is to support discovery of learning objects and their use within (e )learning management systems.<br /><br />IEEE LOM is somewhat more detailed than <br />simple DC.<br /><br />There is a memorandum of understanding between DCMI and LOM at<br /><br /><a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/12/06/dcmi-ieee-mou" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/2000/12/06/dcmi-ieee-mou</a>/<br /><br />While there is some overlap of semantics between DC and LOM, encoding syntax details in XML are significantly different.

	<p>
	 Stuart Sutton<br>Professor in the Information School. Member of the DCMI Usage Board and the DCMI Advisory Board. Co-Chair of the DC-Education Working Group. <p /> Jim, currently, DCMI has no independent legal status beyond those rights derived from its host organization (OCLC ) that provides services, resources and salaried employees with commitments to DCMI. The intellectual property (IP ) statement for DCMI can be found at the following URL: <a href="http://www.dublincore.org/about/copyright/#copyright" target=_BLANK>http://www.dublincore.org/about/copyright/#copyright</a> <br /><br />In trying to answer your question, it is important that you understand that the answer provided here is not intended in any way as legal advice *or* as a statement of rights binding on OCLC, DCMI, or any other entity. They are merely the opinion of this author--someone with a fairly extensive understanding of both IP law in the United States and in the organization of DCMI.<br /><br />That said, it is important to distinguish copyright interests held in the DCMI Web site and copyright interests in individual documents found on the Web site. As to the first of these interests (the Web site ), the site exists on a server owned and operated by OCLC. The design work (including navigation and a fair mount of the content etc. ) are largely the product of employees of OCLC produced within the scope of their employment and, therefore, under U.S. law would be the IP of OCLC as "work for hire." Also, IP rights in the Web site extend to the collation of works as a compilation under U.S. law. These IP rights in no way alter or extend IP rights in the individual works in the compilation.<br /><br />I am assuming, however, that your concern is less with the Web site and more with the IP rights in individual documents on the Web site. Unfortunately, under current organizational circumstances, there is no clear answer that you are likely to find satisfying with regard to any specific document. The DCMI IP statement says of DCMI documents: "Who holds the copyright on DCMI documents? The original author of the document. Many documents are created by DCMI and we consequently hold the copyright. Owners who allow their works to be published on the DCMI site retain the copyright, but agree to the DCMI license for the redistribution of those materials from our site." This statement does nothing more than restate the outline of U.S. copyright law under Title 17 of the United States Code. Since many of the documents on the DCMI Web site are created by individuals and groups of individuals that have no legal affiliation with DCMI other than serving as volunteers (i.e., they are not employees of DCMI or independent contractors commissioned in writing by DCMI to create such documents ), IP rights in those documents vest in those individuals or groups of individuals under United States law (Title 17 of the United States Code ). As the DCMI PI statement notes, such owners allow their works to be published on the DCMI site but retain full IP rights and may take appropriate legal action against anyone that violates the DCMI license for the redistribution of those materials from the site.<br /><br />Hope this helps. <p />

While in most instances, it is not the sort of reference that is likely to get anyone into trouble in terms of their understandings of the Dublin Core metadata model. However, it is probably best *not* to think of element refinements as sub-elements. Many prefer to think of an element refinement as simply another element that just happens to provide a more restricted set of semantics than the element it "refines". <p />

None of the other terms ('national centre, network information support, library community, awareness, research, information services,public library networking, bibliographic management, distributed library systems, metadata, resource discovery, conferences,lectures, workshops' ) are taken from a classification system - they are free-text keywords - therefore no classification system is indicated. <p />

        <br/>
          I am attempting to build a site where users can submit archival material to a digital archive.  Items in the archive will be described in DC based on input to a web form.<br /><br />My question: what element or qualified element ought I use to give the name of the person submitting the material?

	<p>
	 Diane I. Hillmann<br>Editor, "Using Dublin Core"Research Librarian, Cornell University Library <p /> Eli:<br /><br />The answer to your question could vary depending on what relationship the submitter has to the resource. A "person" representing an institution that holds and item might be the submitter, but may not be as important as the institution in describing the resource itself. On the other hand, that "person" may be important in an administrative sense, as being the creator of the metadata record about the resource, and may need to be recorded by you as part of the that transaction, but not necessarily exposed by you as a publisher or creator in a description of the resource.<br /><br />If indeed the submitter is more than just the creator of the metadata, the Publisher element might be appropriate. Publisher is defined in DC as "An entity responsible for making the resource available." This is intentionally a bit fuzzy, and covers a possiblly broad range of activities. It is quite distinct from either "creation" which implies responsibility for the content of the resource, or "provenance," which seems to carry a different emphasis.<br /><br />The Merriam Webster Dictionary, for instance, defines Provenance as "the history of ownership of a valued object or work of art or literature." Another definition I found, from the Glossary of Archival Terms (Simon Fraser University, Archives and Records Management Department ) [<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/archives/glossary.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.sfu.ca/archives/glossary.html</A>] defines it as "The person(s ) or office(s ) of origin of records, i.e., the person(s ), family (families ), or corporate body (bodies ) that created and/or accumulated and used records in the course of that creator's activities or functions." <br />Both of these definitions emphasize "ownership" rather than creation of content or the responsibility for making the resource available.<br /><br /> I have seen suggestions that the Location element from the DC Libraries Application Profile might be used instead, but if you look at the definition for the MARC 852 field (to which that MODS element looks for definition [<a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhold.html#mrcb852" target=_BLANK>http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhold.html#mrcb852</a>] ), you can see that the Location "Identifies the organization holding the item or from which it is available. May also contain detailed information about how to locate the item in a collection." Subfield "a" of that field is defined as "The institution or person holding the item or from which access is given. Contains a MARC code for the organization or the name of the institution or person holding the item." This seems to me much more a passive assertionâ€”the entity that holds an item is not necessarily the same one that makes it available, nor should one assume that it wishes to do so!<br /><br />So, again, whether the submitter is more relevant to the metadata itself or the resource is the crux of the issue, and from there you may find your answer.<br /><br /> <p />

I was told there where now 16, where the last one added was the element &quot;Audience&quot;.<br />Looking at your website under the heading elements, I still find 15 and a proposal for a 16th element. Can you tell me what the current status on the 16th element is?<br /><br />Thank  you in advance for your help<br /><br />With kind regards<br /><br />Walther Hasselo<br />City Archives<br />Leiden<br />The Netherlands

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Walther:<br /><br />There are still 15 elements in simple Dublin Core, those elements described in the document at: <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dces</A>/. All of these terms are at the element level. <br /><br />Audience is indeed a valid DC term, at the element level (see <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#audience" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#audience</a> ), but is not included in the group of 15 "core" elements, partially because those original 15 are seen as of more general use than any of the refinements and other terms approved more recently.<br /><br />The DC namespaces reflect this difference: Audience appears in the same namespace as the refinements, not the original 15 elements. See <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/2001/10/26/dcmi-namespace" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/documents/2001/10/26/dcmi-namespace</a>/ for the full Namespace Policy document.<br /><br />I hope this isn't too confusing!<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" and member DCMI Usage Board <p />

          Is it okay if I use the following Dublin Core element for the ISSN of a series?<br /><br />&lt;META NAME=&quot;DC.Identifier&quot; SCHEME=&quot;ISSN&quot; CONTENT=&quot;ISSN 1617-3309&quot;&gt;<br /><br />The name of this series is: Freiberger Dissertationen Online. The ISSN is: 1617-3309<br /><br />The single Dissertations in this series have a number.<br /><br />And which element should be used for the number within this series?<br />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> If you are creating a metadata record for the series itself, then your approach seems reasonable. However, if you are creating a record for an item within the series, information in the IDENTIFIER element should relate to the item, not the series.<br /><br />One way to figure out how standard cataloging concepts work with Dublin Core is to take a look at the standard mapping between MARC and DC maintained at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html" target=_BLANK>http://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html</A>. You will note there that 4XX and 8XX tags map to the qualified RELATION element, with a refinement IsPartOf. <br /><br />When using the RELATION element for this purpose, the title, ISSN and number could be represented as a string, for example:<br /><br />Freiberger Dissertationen Online (ISSN:1617-3309 ), no. 22<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core"<br /><br /> <p />

          Does the emphasis on &quot;resource discovery&quot; imply that DC elements should primarily be embedded in the actual resources?  I'm interested in using DC elements to build catalogs of resources, do you think that would somehow go against the spirit of DC?<br />

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> The decision of whether or not to embed DC elements within a resource or carry the metadata separately in an external database is entirely up to the implementor. It is certainly true that most implementations do not embed DC elements within a resource, and there are maintenance issues inherent in that approach.<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />

          What's the difference between a thesaurus and a classification?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Your question about the difference between thesauri and classifications is interesting. From Merriam Webster's Dictionary:<br /><br />Thesaurus: a book of words or of information about a particular field or set of concepts; especially : a book of words and their synonyms; b ) : a list of subject headings or descriptors usually with a cross-reference system for use in the organization of a collection of documents for reference and<br />retrieval.<br /><br />Classification: systematic arrangement in groups or categories according to<br />established criteria; specifically : TAXONOMY<br /><br />From these definitions it appears that a thesaurus implies a cross-references of some sort, e.g., among languages and synonyms.<br /><br />A classification does not imply any cross-references, and is typically a taxonomy. I think it is important to maintain the differences. One should know when one is addressing a classification versus a thesaurus. Your expectations will be different for the two, as a classification implies a unique term for every concept or definition.<br /><br />A third category is Authority List. An authority list has no meanings attached to the terms, but the terms may be arranged in a hierarchy (e.g., LCSH ).<br /> <br />Frequently people are building an authority list when they think they are building a classification. <br /><br />Working definitions of each of these is important, although the boundaries among them are not clear. The structure (e.g., list, hierarchy, links ) is not the same as the function.<br /> <br />Thomas D. Wason, Ph. D.<br /> <p />

          Our art history professors would like to see more information on the cataloging record that emphasizes features of the object depicted in the art slides we prepare for their use.  Do you think Dublin Core could help us toward this end?

	 ASKDCMI Administrator<br> <p /> Dublin Core can accommodate those kinds of needs in a number of different ways--which you choose to implement depends on how you think you'll use the data and who you might be sharing it with.<br /><br />The simplest way would be to use keywords in SUBJECT or to describe the object or objects depicted in DESCRIPTION. <br /><br />If you wished to do something more complex, either using controlled vocabularies or an application profile specifying elements from another metadata format, that should be possible but would require more planning and documentation to be successfully implemented. <br /><br />You might wish to take a look at some of the museum projects on the DCMI website (<href a="<a href="http://dublincore.org/projects/>http://dublincore.org/projects/</a" target=_BLANK>http://dublincore.org/projects/>http://dublincore.org/<BR>projects/</a</a>> ) and see if they are moving in similar directions.<br /><br />Diane Hillmann<br />Editor, "Using Dublin Core" <p />
