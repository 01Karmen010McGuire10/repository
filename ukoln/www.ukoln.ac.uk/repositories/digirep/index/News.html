<b>Open Scholarship 06</b>
</p><p>Open Scholarship 2006: Registration closes 30th September
</p><p>Open Scholarship 2006: New Challenges for Open Access Repositories is a companion European Conference to the OAI meetings at CERN in Geneva, and to the Nordic Scholarly Communication Conferences, and is aimed at Librarians, University Administrators, funders, academics and technical specialists.
</p><p>This should be an excellent conference with many of the key figures in European repository development speaking or attending. It offers a great opportunity for networking and for exchanging ideas, comparing work and keeping up to speed with the latest developments from across Europe.
</p><p>Please note that the early bird registration closed on the 31 August (150) and the registration fee has now risen to 180 from the 1st of September. Details of registration are available at:
</p><p><a href="http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/registration.html" class='external free' title="http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/registration.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/registration.html</a>
</p><p>Conference Update
</p><p>Opportunities are still available to promote your work in open access and scholarly communication in the poster session of OPEN SCHOLARSHIP 2006: NEW CHALLENGES FOR OPEN ACCESS REPOSITORIES
</p><p>Key themes for posters include:
</p>
<pre>   * Repository Developments
   * Added Value Services
   * Quality Assessment
   * Policies and Implementation
   * Sustainability
</pre>
<p>Posters should be submitted by the end of September 2006 for consideration by the Organising Committee. Please provide your contact details, as well as the poster title and a brief abstract (250 words max). Accepted posters will be displayed as part of a posters slot in the programme and enable participants to discuss their posters and work with conference attendees.
</p><p>Poster proposals can be submitted online at:
</p><p><a href="http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/posters.html" class='external free' title="http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/posters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/openscholarship/posters.html</a>
</p><p>We are also delighted that a fourth tutorial on the "EPrints Application Profile" will be available in the Tutorials session on Wednesday, 18th of October.
</p><p>This tutorial, run by Julie Allinson (UKOLN, University of Bath) and Andy Powell (Eduserv Foundation) offers an introduction to the Eprints Application Profile, a Dublin Core metadata profile developed to facilitate the creation and sharing of a richer set of metadata for describing scholarly works (eprints) than currently offered by simple Dublin Core.  The Profile makes use of the Dublin Core Abstract Model and FRBR to group together descriptions of different expressions of a work.
</p><p>The application profile has been developed with funding from JISC and is hoped to form the basis for the UK eprint search engine currently being developed by Intute.  The tutorial will be of use to anybody with an interest in metadata, particularly the metadata used to describe scholarly works in institutional, and other, repositories.  Those for whom this tutorial may be of special interest include repository managers or administrators; developers or implementers of repository software; librarians; and developers of aggregator services.  Those interested in implementing the Eprints Application Profile in their own repository are particularly encouraged to attend.
</p><p>The updated programme for the conference is available here:

<b>Overcoming the obstacles of harvesting and searching digital repositories from federated searching toolkits, and embedding them in VLEs</b>
</p><p>The following paper has been produced by members of the <a href="/repositories/digirep/index/PERX" title="PERX">PERX</a> Project:
</p><p>Chumbe, Santiago and MacLeod, Roddy and Barker, Phil and Moffat, Malcolm and Rist, Roger (2006) 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, Athens, Greece.

</p><p><i><b>Abstract</b></i>
</p><p>This paper addresses two important needs. The first one is the need to alleviate the resource discovery task across digital repositories by subject, which includes the ability of searching heterogeneous sources that apply to a specific audience (e.g. engineering academics) or purpose (e.g. research, teaching) from one access point. The second need is to provide toolkits for federated searching which are able to be embedded in electronic learning environments used by lecturers, students and researchers. Most of these environments are institutional Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and Portals. Our study will show that the satisfaction of both needs faces important obstacles. On one side, standard exchange formats such as Z39.50 or OAI, developed precisely to facilitate the transfer or sharing of data between computer systems, present obstacles that make the harvesting and searching of data from digital repositories a challenging process. On the other side, VLEs are often restricted in their ability to allow the sharing and re-use of external e-learning sources discovered by federated searching toolkits. A solution for these obstacles, based on a service-oriented architecture approach, is suggested and explored on a pilot system. The aim of our research is the realisation of the concept of flexible federated searching. The intention is that the VLE user should be able to use whatever search tool he/she likes for whatever repositories he/she needs to search, without concern for how the tool and the repositories manage to communicate, or how the tool makes search results available to other VLE components. The pilot system attempts to demonstrate that most of the flexible federated searching concept can be achieved by making proper use of current interoperability standards for digital repositories and e-learning systems.

Although the target repositories included in the Pilot are relevant to engineering, the cross-searching methods and interface used, plus the range of repository types included, should be of interest to many as a demonstrator of one method of resource discovery across multiple digital repositories.
</p><p>Twenty-eight repositories are currently cross-searched by the Pilot.  These include: the Directory of Open Access Journals (engineering and technology sections), DSpace at MIT, the Energy Citations Database, the GROW Digital Library, NASA Technical Reports, Jorum, ePrints UK, Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), National Engineering Education Delivery System (NEEDS), Australian Research Repositories Online to the World (ARROW), CISTI - Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information, Caltech Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory Technical Reports, and several more established repositories of interest to the engineering community. More repositories will be added to the Pilot as they are identified and configured.
</p><p>An important purpose of the PerX pilot is to help scope a possible future cross-search service. With this in mind, feedback on the Pilot would be much appreciated. A 60 second survey is available at: <a href="http://www.engineering.ac.uk/index.html?action=quest" class='external free' title="http://www.engineering.ac.uk/index.html?action=quest" rel="nofollow">http://www.engineering.ac.uk/index.html?action=quest</a> and those providing feedback will be entered into a draw to win £100 of Amazon vouchers.

<b>GRADE survey on geospatial content in Institutional Repositories</b>
</p><p>The JISC Digital Repositories project '<a href="/repositories/digirep/index/GRADE" title="GRADE">GRADE</a>&nbsp;: Scoping a Geospatial Repository for Academic Deposit and Extraction' is undertaking a survey to understand the extent to which existing Institutional Repositories currently manage geospatial content. 
</p><p>Following this baseline audit of institutional repositories GRADE can provide a firm evidence base for assertions on how institutional repositories deal with geospatial data in actuality and expose current practices, benefits and limitations. This will assist in weighing the merits of an institutional vs. media-centric repository approach and shed light on whether technology can assist to blur these distinctions and remove the repository choice dilemma. It will also help delineate best practices for other repositories to adhere to.
</p><p>The survey is at <a href="http://edina.ac.uk/projects/grade/status4.html" class='external free' title="http://edina.ac.uk/projects/grade/status4.html" rel="nofollow">http://edina.ac.uk/projects/grade/status4.html</a>.
</p><p>PLEASE take a few minutes and help GRADE by completing the survey.   
</p><p>There is an Amazon book token prize as an added incentive

<b>Use of copyright material in learning support</b>
</p><p>Of potential interest to projects looking at copyright issues and e-learning is the following project:
</p><p>LISU (Library and Information and Statistics Unit), based in the Department of Information Science at Loughborough University, are carrying out a survey on the use of copyright material for learning support in Higher Education. It looks at use of teaching materials, the ways in which these are made available to students, how third party material is made available to students, it also looks at trends in use and how this might develop over the next three years, copyright clearance and finally online learning environments.
</p><p>Additional details are available from LISU project page:  <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dils/lisu/pages/projects/projects.html" class='external free' title="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dils/lisu/pages/projects/projects.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/dils/lisu/pages/projects/projects.html</a>

<b>Rights and Rewards in Blended Institutional Repositories - Academic Survey released</b>
</p><p>One of the aims of this project is to addresses the motivational issues facing depositors of material to repositories. What 'Rights' need to be protected and what 'Rewards' would encourage contribution. A survey has been undertaken to gather views  on these two issues, the results are now available on the project website in the Documents section.
