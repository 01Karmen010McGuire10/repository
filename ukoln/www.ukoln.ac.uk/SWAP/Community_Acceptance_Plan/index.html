<p>The current instantiation of Eprints Application Profile work was 
signed-off at in early September.  This work has been coordinated by 
Julie Allinson, Digital Repositories Support team, UKOLN, and Andy 
Powell, Eduserv Foundation.
</p><p>During the period May - July 2006, several documents have been produced to support the Application Profile.  
</p>
<ul><li> To ensure the Profile is embedded into repository practice in the UK and its currency maintained, it is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that JISC appoint an agency to maintain the profile.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that UKOLN, through the Digital
 Repositories Support team within whose remit the work currently falls, 
take on responsibility for maintaining the Profile.  
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that UKOLN register the DCAP with the prototype JISC IE Metadata Schema Registry.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that UKOLN take on 
responsibility for maintaining the new terms that have been created for 
use in the Profile, and for ensuring that descriptions of those terms 
are made available in accordance with current good practice guidelines
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Dissemination and community liaison would form part of this responsibility.
</li></ul>
<p>Substantive changes to the Profile would be out of scope for this 
maintenance activity, although UKOLN would be well-placed to alert JISC 
to additional work needed.

<p>As part of the Eprints Application Profile activity (May - June 
2006), several community engagement activities have been undertaken, 
including:
</p>
<ul><li> A <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Application_Profile#Working_Group" title="Eprints Application Profile">Working Group</a>
 was assembled to work on the Profile, including representatives of 
DCMI, the Digital Repositories Programme, Intute, Sherpa, AHDS, eprints,
 DSpace and Fedora.
</li><li> A wider <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Eprints_Application_Profile#Feedback_Group" title="Eprints Application Profile">Feedback Group</a> invited comments from representatives of European projects, FRBR and other experts from the community.
</li><li> The eprints-application-profile@jiscmail.ac.uk mailing list 
was established to facilitate discussion across the working group and 
feedback group.
</li><li> The JISC Digital Repositories Programme wiki (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/" class="external free" title="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/</a>) was used for the development of all documents produced.  At all stages, documents have been publicly available.
</li><li> Emails to relevant lists (dc-libraries@jiscmail.ac.uk, 
jisc-repositories@jiscmail.ac.uk) have alerted the community to the 
work. Several responses to these e-mail messages have provided 
additional members to the feedback group.
</li><li> Dissemination of the Profile has been undertaken wherever 
opportunities have arisen, in presentations, ah-hoc discussions and via 
jiscmail e-mail lists.
<ul><li>for example Andy Powell and Julie Allinson have referenced this 
work in presentations at the JISC-CNI Conference, the Institutional Web 
Managers Workshop and the Intute UK repository search meeting.
</li></ul>

<p>As the activities of these groups are wound-down, the following <i><b>recommendations</b></i> for continuing and extending the level of community engagement achieved are proposed:
</p>
<ul><li> Consider establishing a DCMI working group following on from 
the eprints workshop at the Dublin Core conference in October 2006.  
Roll the eprints-application-profile jiscmail list into a dc- list.
<ul><li> (alternatively, if a DCMI WG is not established, invite the 
small feedback community established for the current work to maintain 
their membership to the eprints-application-profile mailing list; widen 
the membership of this list by inviting additional community 
representatives to join)
</li><li> open the membership of the working group and list to a wider 
audience, encouraging community discussion of issues raised by 
deployment of the profile.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> JISC Programme Managers disseminate the Profile
<ul><li> Recommendations for use of the Profile should be built into 
future funding calls under the JISC Capital Programme to encourage 
uptake.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Extend the work of the feedback group (unfunded) into a 
dissemination and feedback period (August - October 2006).  Work to 
include the following:
<ul><li> workshop at DC 2006
</li><li> general awareness-raising through posts to email lists, f2f discussions etc.
</li><li> original working group and feedback group members encouraged to continue ad-hoc dissemination
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Host a community engagement event (funded from existing budget) in September or October
<ul><li> this would replace the proposed second working group meeting
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> UKOLN will register the DCAP with the prototype JISC IE Metadata Schema Registry.
</li></ul>

<p>In order to implement the Eprints Application Profile, the following deployment stages are anticipated:  
</p><p>Note: This is dependent, in part, on the availability of the Dublin Core XML/RDF schemas (see <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Community_Acceptance_Plan#A_note_about_XML" title="Community Acceptance Plan">A note about XML</a>)
</p><p><b>Software developers:</b><br>
</p>
<ul><li> Initially, developers of DSpace, Fedora and Eprints create an 
add-on or plug-in to enable repositories to create and expose 
eprints-compliant metadata records.  Roll-out as part of core future 
releases should be factored into development activities, as necessary.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that discussions with 
developers are held to agree development path.  Initially, this should 
be limited to developers of commonly-deployed open-source repository 
software (see <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Community_Acceptance_Plan#Responses_from_developers" title="Community Acceptance Plan">Responses from developers</a>):

</li></ul>
<p>Commercial suppliers should be engaged later in the process.
</p><p><b>Repositories:</b><br>
</p>
<ul><li> Institutional (and other) repositories upgrade their repository software with the new plug-in or patch.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Institutional repositories to test the profile, review current 
local metadata practices, make changes to metadata captured from the 
user and undertake any global editing or re-mapping of current content 
in order to comply with the eprints application profile.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that some early adopters are engaged to test the profile.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that any necessary (minor) revisions are incorporated; requirements for major revisions should be communicated to JISC
</li></ul>
<p><b>Aggregators/Service Providers:</b><br>
</p>
<ul><li> The Intute (ePrints UK) OAI-PMH harvester configured to harvest
 records compliant with the eprints application profile and related 
software modified to take advantage of the richer metadata contained 
therein.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Other OAI-PMH harvesters (e.g. Southampton and EDINA) encouraged to do likewise.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that Aggregators/Service 
Providers recommend the exposure, by repositories, of metadata records 
compliant with the eprints application profile.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is <i><b>recommended</b></i> that JISC (and other funding bodies) recommend compliance, particularly through future funding calls.

<p>From Jim Downing:
</p><p><i>The upcoming release of DSpace (1.4) has extensible metadata 
support, and the current production release has a technology to 
customize the forms in the ingest process, so in theory it should be 
possible for someone to create an add-on to support the JISC application
 profile.  I'll go back to the software to check that this would work.</i>
</p><p><i>There's definitely an issue for the installed base in the UK -
 many installations don't upgrade for quite some time after a version is
 released. This would be an extra incentive though!</i>
</p><p><i>I think that this wouldn't be appropriate for inclusion in the
 core DSpace release. We're encouraging the development of this kind of 
functionality as add-ons, and there's a mechanism for adding them to a 
1.4 DSpace source distribution. In practical terms, what this really 
means is that the JISC ePrints application profile will have to provide 
for it's own maintenance and distribution.</i>
</p><p><i>As far as harvesting exposure goes, then it would be straightforward to add an eprints feed alongside the current dumbed</i>
down feed.<i></i>

<p>From Chris Awre:
</p><p><i>Fedora as a system will not, as I understand it, have a 
problem implementing the profile, as the metadata structures and 
datastreams you can establish are flexible.  It is on the harvesting 
side that I am unsure currently and where I will seek clarification.  
Fedora does allow OAI harvesting of DC metadata, but the documentation 
does not make it clear whether this is limited to simple DC or whether 
qualified DC would also count.  I suspect not, and that an extension of 
what can be harvested will be needed.  Having said that, this issue of 
only being able to harvest DC has been raised already and the Fedora 
team are working on a broader service that should allow multiple 
metadata datastreams to be harvestable, which would cover the eprints 
profile.</i>
</p><p><i>In summary, Fedora itself should have no problems working with
 the e-prints profile so long as the repository owner has set up the 
appropriate datastream.  Such a datastream won't be pre-set as none are 
in Fedora (except  a basic simple DC one for internal management 
purposes) so this would require some work on behalf of individual 
repositories.  However, since Fedora adopters accept that they have to 
create all the different datastreams they need this should not be an 
issue.  As regards harvesting, any individual datastream can now be 
harvested from Fedora.  As such, if the e-prints profile datastream has 
been configured it can be set up as the one to be harvested.</i>
</p><p><i>Both VTLS and Fez have indicated they also do not see a 
problem working with the profile.  I have directed both camps to the 
profile wiki, though, so they can take a more detailed look and I am 
awaiting feedback from this.</i>
</p><p><i>On the whole, then, it looks like the Fedora community will be able to work with the e-prints profile.</i>

<p>From Linda Kerr and Phil Cross, Intute:
</p><p><em>Community acceptance of a standard ePrints Application 
Profile, based on DC, was identified in the eprints UK project final 
report as necessary for repository aggregators to reliably access the 
full-text of open access documents. Its wide implementation and use 
would therefore be beneficial to a UK Repository Search Service that 
seeks to provide added-value services based in part on data mining 
techniques requiring access to full-text documents. In addition, the 
extra richness of the ePrints Application Profile, together with its 
extensibility, will enable further added-value services not yet 
envisaged. (The first stage of the UK Repository Search Service project 
will determine what extra value-added services we will investigate, 
together with the implications for metadata collection these will have).
 The international adoption of the profile would improve resource 
discovery and metadata sharing between aggregating services further.
</em></p><p><em>Adoption of the metadata standard by repository software
 developers in a way which would help users add appropriate metadata to 
their publications, automating as much of the process as possible, will 
be essential to providing high quality metadata across the different 
platforms available. It will also be necessary for repository 
administrators to be able to add the application profile as an option 
for exporting metadata (via the OAI-PMH protocol for our project) as 
easily as possible, and ideally via simple plugins that could be 
downloaded from the Search Service web site. These are clearly 
implications for how well the application profile fits with the data 
models used by the major eprint repository developers. </em>

<p>The current activity has taken a UK-focussed approach to specifying 
an application profile.  Where available, application profiles for 
international projects and services have been considered (see <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Functional_Requirements" title="Functional Requirements">Functional Requirements</a>) and international representatives invited to join the feedback group.
</p>
<ul><li> Establishing a DCMI Working Group would promote international uptake and consultation.
</li></ul>

<p>The current <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/repositories/digirep/index/Scholarly_Works_Application_Profile" title="Scholarly Works Application Profile">Scholarly Works Application Profile</a>
 hasn't committed to delivering XML schemas.  The Profile is dependent 
on the revised guidelines for expressing Dublin Core metadata in XML and
 in RDF.  These documents are currently being considered by the DCMI 
Usage Board prior to the October conference.

<p>Discussions on the eprints-application-profile mailing list have highlighted the following areas for future work:
</p>
<ul><li> Auto-extraction of metadata
</li><li> Automatic classification techniques
</li><li> Tracking metadata records through intermediate hosts
</li><li> Extending the profile for other types of Scholarly Works, e.g.
 aggregations of eprints (journal issues, overlay journals), non-text 
scholarly output (e.g. those listed in RAE description).  It is hoped 
that JISC funding in the area of application profile development will 
cover some of these and that, in so doing, JISC will take a lead in 
ensuring that approaches are consistent.
</li><li> The use of service registries and other shared services, e.g. 
terminology services, identifier services, profiling services etc.
</li><li> more ...
