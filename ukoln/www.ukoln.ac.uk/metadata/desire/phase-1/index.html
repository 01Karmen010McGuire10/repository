<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Phase 1 of the DESIRE (Development of a European Service for Information on Research and Education)
project was funded by the European Union as part of the Telematics for Research Sector of the Fourth
Framework Programme. DESIRE I investigated a series of issues relating to Web technologies and the
implementation of pilot information services on behalf of European researchers. Areas of research included
cataloguing and indexing, caching, security issues and training. DESIRE I included a total of 23 partners</p>

<p>UKOLN's involvement in DESIRE I was focussed on Work Package 3 (WP3) which was concerned with Resource discovery and
indexing. Other partners in WP3 included:</p>


<p>The eLib ROADS project partners:</p>

<ul>
<li>Institute of Learning and Research Technology (ILRT), University of Bristol [UK]</li>
<li>The Department of Computer Studies, Loughborough University [UK]</li></ul>

<p>Together with:</p>
<ul>
<li>NetLab: Lund University Library Development Department, University of Lund [Sweden]</li>
<li>Koninklijke Bibliotheek: the National Library of the Netherlands.</li></ul>

<h3>DESIRE II</h3>



<p>Work on DESIRE I started in 1996 and the project finished in 1998. A second phase of DESIRE began in July
1998 with a reduced number of partners and a more focussed scope. Issues being investigated in DESIRE II include
distributed Web indexing, subject-based Web cataloguing, directory services, and caching. Further Information on
DESIRE phase 2 can be found on the DESIRE Web pages:
