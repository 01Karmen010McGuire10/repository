<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
DCMI has two documents concerning the use of Dublin Core metadata in
RDF/XML.  The first,
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml/">
Expressing Simple Dublin Core in RDF/XML</a>
[SIMPLEDC-RDF]
is a 'recommendation'
and describes how to encode simple DC in RDF/XML.
The second,
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml/">
Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF/XML</a>
[QUALIFIEDDC-RDF]
is a 'proposed recommendation'
and describes how to encode qualified DC in RDF/XML.
</p>
<p>
More recently, the DC Architecture WG has developed the
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/abstract-model/">
DCMI Abstract Model</a>
[DCMI-AM]
which provides a reference model against which particular
<a href="http://dublincore.org/resources/expressions/">DC encoding guidelines</a>
[DCMI-ENCODINGS]
can be compared. 
</p>
<p>
The Abstract Model defines a terminology that includes the following terms
(the definitions are repeated here for clarity):
</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>resource</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>resource</i> is anything that has identity. Familiar
examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g.,
"today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of
other <i>resources</i>. Not all <i>resources</i> are network
"retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, concepts and bound books in
a library can also be considered <i>resources</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>resource URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>resource URI</i> is a URI that identifies a single <i>resource</i>.
</dd>

<dt><i>property</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>property</i> is a specific aspect, characteristic,
attribute, or relation used to describe <i>resources</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>property URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>property URI</i> is a URI that identifies a single <i>property</i>.
</dd>

<dt><i>value</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value</i> is the physical or conceptual entity that is associated
with a <i>property</i> when it is used to describe a <i>resource</i>.

<dt><i>value URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value URI</i> is a URI that identifies the <i>value</i> of a <i>
property</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>value string</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value string</i> is a simple string that represents the
<i>value</i> of a <i>property</i>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
One issue with the two DCMI documents for encoding DC in RDF/XML is that
they each recommend a different mechanism for encoding the
<i>value string</i> that represents the <i>value</i> of a
<i>property</i>.
In the simple DC recommendation, a construct represented by the
RDF graph in figure 1 is used.  This construct uses a literal string as
the value of the property.
In the qualified DC proposed recommendation, a construct represented by the
RDF graph in figure 2 is used.
This construct represents the <i>value</i> of the <i>property</i> as
an intermediate (often blank) node,
allowing further properties to be used to describe
the <i>value</i> resource, including a simple <i>value string</i>
(using rdfs:label).
</p>
<table align="center" boder="0" summary="Figures" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td align="center">
<img src="figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1" />
</td>
<td align="center">
<img src="figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align="center">Figure 1</th>
<th align="center">Figure 2</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In terms of the Abstract Model both these constructs represent the same
semantics -
they both represent a <i>resource URI</i>, a <i>property URI</i> and
a <i>value string</i>.
However, in terms of the RDF model, the two constructs are different - non-DCMI
applications would not recognise the two graphs as being synonimous.
Perhaps more importantly, the use of these different constructs
in a DCMI recommendation and a DCMI proposed recommendation has led to
some confusion in the RDF implementor community, with some people following
one recommendation and others following the other.
The confusion is particularly accute where the resource represented by the
intermediate node is relatively obvious, for example a person or organisation,
as is the case with the dc:creator, dc:contributor and dc:publisher
properties.
This potentially leads to less interoperability between DC metadata
applications than might otherwise be achieved.
</p>

<p>
Note that DCMI currently
makes no recommendations about the class of the intermediate
node, nor about whether it should be assigned a URI or be generated
as a blank node.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this document makes some initial recommendations
for dealing with this situation.
</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></dt>
<dd>
DC-aware software applications that consume metadata records encoded
according to either of the two DCMI documents for encoding DC in RDF/XML
should treat the two constructs above as synonimous.
Applications may transform DC RDF graphs between the two forms in
either direction (either by adding an intermediate blank node or by
removing the intermediate node) as and when necessary.
</dd>
<i>
<dt><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></dt>
<dd>
DC-aware software applications that generate metadata records encoded as
RDF/XML should use the second construct above (with the
intermediate node).
This form more closely represents the Abstract Model for DC descriptions
and generating the intermediate node when the metadata record is
first created provides consuming applications with
a 'hook' on which further descriptions of the value can be hung, without needing
to modify the structure of the consumed metadata record.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Note that it might be argued that recommendation 2 is unnecessary given
recommendation 1, since if DC-aware software applications
that consume metadata records are allowed to treat the
two constructs as synonimous then it does not matter which form
other software applications generate.
However, the intention of recommendation 2 is to provide a greater
level of interoperability between DC RDF/XML records from different sources
when they are
consumed by software applications that are not DC-aware - i.e. that
have no knowledge of recommendation 1.
</p>
<p>
This option effectively deprecates DCMI's simple DC in RDF recommendation in its
current form, since it essentially recommends against following the
guidelines in that document.
</p>
</i>
<p>
A small task force of the DC-Architecture WG is currently developing a
revised set of recommendations for how all the features of the
DCMI Abstract Model should be encoded using RDF.
The recommendations in this document should be treated as interim, pending
adoption of the decisions of that task force.
