<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
DCMI has two documents concerning the use of Dublin Core metadata in
RDF.  The first,
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmes-xml/">
Expressing Simple Dublin Core in RDF/XML</a> is a 'recommendation'
and describes how to encode simple DC in RDF/XML.
The second,
<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-rdf-xml/">
Expressing Qualified Dublin Core in RDF / XML</a>
is a 'proposed recommendation'
and describes how to encode qualified DC in RDF/XML.
</p>
<p>
More recently, the DC Architecture WG has been developing a
<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcmi/abstract-model/">
DCMI Abstract Model</a>
which provides a reference model against which particular DC encoding guidelines can be compared. 
</p>
<p>
The Abstract Model defines a terminology that includes the following terms
(the definitions are repeated here for clarity):
</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>resource</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>resource</i> is anything that has identity. Familiar
examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g.,
"today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of
other <i>resources</i>. Not all <i>resources</i> are network
"retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, concepts and bound books in
a library can also be considered <i>resources</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>resource URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>resource URI</i> is a URI that identifies a single <i>resource</i>.
</dd>

<dt><i>property</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>property</i> is a specific aspect, characteristic,
attribute, or relation used to describe <i>resources</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>property URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>property URI</i> is a URI that identifies a single <i>property</i>.
</dd>

<dt><i>value</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value</i> is the physical or conceptual entity that is associated
with a <i>property</i> when it is used to describe a <i>resource</i>.

<dt><i>value URI</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value URI</i> is a URI that identifies the <i>value</i> of a <i>
property</i>.</dd>

<dt><i>value string</i></dt>

<dd>A <i>value string</i> is a simple string that represents the
<i>value</i> of a <i>property</i>.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
One issue with the two DCMI documents for encoding DC in RDF/XML is that
they each recommend a different mechanism for encoding the
<i>value string</i> that represents the <i>value</i> of a
<i>property</i>.
In the simple DC recommendation, a construct represented by the
RDF graph in figure 1 is used.  This construct uses a literal string as
the value of the property.
In the qualified DC proposed recommendation, a construct represented by the
RDF graph in figure 2 is used.
This construct represents the <i>value</i> of the <i>property</i> as
an intermediate (often blank) node,
allowing further properties to be used to describe
the <i>value</i> resource, including a simple <i>value string</i>
(using rdfs:label).
</p>
<table align="center" boder="0" summary="Figures" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td align="center">
<img src="figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1" />
</td>
<td align="center">
<img src="figure2.gif" alt="Figure 2" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align="center">Figure 1</th>
<th align="center">Figure 2</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In terms of the Abstract Model both these constructs represent the same
semantics -
they both represent a <i>resource URI</i>, a <i>property URI</i> and
a <i>value string</i>.
However, in terms of the RDF model, the two constructs are different - non-DCMI
applications would not recognise the two graphs as being synonimous.
Perhaps more importantly, the use of these different constructs
in a DCMI recommendation and a DCMI proposed recommendation has led to
some confusion in the RDF implementor community, with some people following
one recommendation and others following the other.
The confusion is particularly accute where the resource represented by the
intermediate node is relatively obvious, for example a person or organisation,
as is the case with the dc:creator, dc:contributor and dc:publisher
properties.
This potentially leads to less interoperability between DC metadata
applications than might otherwise be achieved.
</p>

<p>
Note that DCMI currently
makes no recommendations about the class of the intermediate
node, nor about whether it should be assigned a URI or be generated
as a blank node.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of this document reviews some possible options
for dealing with this situation.
</p>

<h2>2. Options</h2>
<h3>2.1 Option 1 - Status quo</h3>
<p>
Do nothing.  Live with the current levels of confusion, such as they are.
We've survived so far!
Continue to recommend the two forms of encoding and leave implementors
to decide which form best serves their need.
</p>
<p>
This option is the easiest for DCMI, since it requires no action.
However, it does nothing to reduce the current levels of confusion in the
implementor community and it doesn't bode well for future interoperability
between DC-based implementations of RDF/XML.
</p>
<p><i>Since writing this document it has been pointed out to me that there is
a stricter interpretation of 'status quo' which is to only support
the current 'simple DC in RDF' recommendation and ignore the 'qualified
DC in RDF' proposed recommendation - on the basis that the 'qualified DC in RDF'
document has never become a recommendation and therefore shouldn't be
being used as the basis for deployment.
While I have some sympathy for this,
I'm not clear that it helps solve our problems.</i></p>

<h3>2.2 Option 2 - Attempt to align the behaviour of consuming applications</h3>
<p>
This option would make recommendations to the developers
of DC-aware software applications about how to handle the metadata
records that they consume.
For example, we could make a single
recommendation along the following lines:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></dt>
<dd>
DC-aware software applications that consume metadata records encoded
according to either of the two DCMI documents for encoding DC in RDF/XML
should treat the two constructs above as synonimous.
Applications may transform DC RDF graphs between the two forms in
either direction (either by adding an intermediate blank node or by
removing the intermediate node) as and when necessary.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
This option providers greater clarity for the DCMI community but doesn't
to much to facilitate better interoperability between applications that
are not aware of DC conventions.
</p>
<h3>2.3 Option 3 - Attempt to align the behaviour of consuming and generating
applications</h3>
<p>
This option would make recommendations to the developers
of DC-aware software applications about both how to handle the metadata
records that they consume and how to generate metadata records.
For example, we could make two
recommendations along the following lines:
<dl>
<dt><strong>Recommendation 1</strong></dt>
<dd>
DC-aware software applications that consume metadata records encoded
according to either of the two DCMI documents for encoding DC in RDF/XML
should treat the two constructs above as synonimous.
Applications may transform DC RDF graphs between the two forms in
either direction (either by adding an intermediate blank node or by
removing the intermediate node) as and when necessary.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Recommendation 2</strong></dt>
<dd>
DC-aware software applications that generate metadata records encoded as
RDF/XML should use the second construct above (with the
intermediate node).
This form more closely represents the Abstract Model for DC descriptions
and generating the intermediate node when the metadata record is
first created provides consuming applications with
a 'hook' on which further descriptions of the value can be hung, without needing
to modify the structure of the consumed metadata record.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Note that it might be argued that recommendation 2 is unnecessary given
recommendation 1, since if DC-aware software applications
that consume metadata records are allowed to treat the
two constructs as synonimous then it does not matter which form
other software applications generate.
However, the intention of recommendation 2 is to provide a greater
level of interoperability between DC RDF/XML records from different sources
when they are
consumed by software applications that are not DC-aware - i.e. that
have no knowledge of recommendation 1.
</p>
<p>
This option effectively deprecates DCMI's simple DC in RDF recommendation in its
current form, since it essentially recommends against following the
guidelines in that document.  The current simple DC in RDF recommendation
would need to be revised or merged with the qualified DC proposed
recommendation in some way.
</p>
<h3>2.4 Option 4 - Attempt to influence the behaviour of the wider Semantic Web
community</h3>
<p>
This option would attempt to convince the wider Semantic Web community
that the two graphs above are semantically equivalent.  This could be done
via the appropriate W3C specifications or by some lighter-weight
implementor agreements.
</p>
<p>
This option has the advantage of leaving current practice on the part of
implementors unchanged, but still achieves a high degree of interoperability
between RDF applications, whether they are DC-aware or not.
Clearly, DCMI would have to work with the W3C and the Semantic Web community
to achieve this end.
</p>
<p><i>Note that since writing this document it has been pointed out to me
by PeteJ that
this option is not sensible, because the two forms are not synonymous in
terms of RDF, and never will be.  Furthermore, there are good examples where one
wouldn't want them to be treated as meaning the same.  So I think we
can forget this option!</i></p>
<h3>2.5 Option 5 - Replicate existing DC property semantics in new properties</h3>
<p>
This option would replicate the existing DC properties as new properties
with essentially the same semantics as they have now
but defined in such a way (using RDFS) that it is explicit that the value
of the property is another resource.
</p>
<p>
For example, DCMI could declare a new term, dcterms:Creator, with essentially the
same semantics as dc:creator but with
the RDFS declaration of the new term making use of the rdfs:range construct to
explicitly indicate that the value is a resource of class dcterms:Agent.
</p>
<p>
This option would have far reaching consequences for the exitsing usage
of DC metadata and for the existing encoding guidelines.
</p>
<h2>3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>
Of the options presented here, my view is that option 1 is no longer
tenable if we want DC to remain a credible standard in the development of the
Semantic Web.
I also think that option 5 is too drastic for DCMI to consider at this
stage in the lifecycle of the standard.
</p>
<p>
Of the remaining options, option 4 looks interesting but my suspicion is that
the Semantic Web community will not be willing to move in this direction.
Option 2 doesn't go far enough in terms of ensuring interoperability.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, my personal view is to move forward with option 3 at this stage.
This option will require some reworking of existing DCMI recommendations
but it doesn't rule out option 4 happening at some future time if this is deemed
to be appropriate by the wider community.
