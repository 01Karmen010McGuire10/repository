<h2>Issues arising from DCMI Abstract Model</h2>

<hr>
<p>This document summarises issues for discussion at the March 2004
meeting of the DC Usage Board that arise out of the <a href=
"../../abstract-model/">DCMI Abstract Model working draft</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a full list of issues arising from the AM - just
those that appear to be of interest to the UB. Apart from the first
two, all these issues are primarily for information at this stage -
no immediate decisions or actions are required by the UB.</p>

<h3>Relation of the AM to other "foundational" documents maintained
by DCMI</h3>

<p>There are a number of older DCMI documents that have overlaps
with the DCMI Abstarct Model Working Draft. I don't think this
matters too much, provided the terminology used across all the
documents is the same and appropriate linkages are put in place
between documents.</p>

<p>More drastic action could be taken, like removing some of the
older documents. However, I don't think that would be justified at
this stage.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Align terminology at appropriate
time.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Add links from older DCMI documentation
to the AM at appropriate time.</p>

<h3>Wording of term defintions</h3>

<p>This is an issue which affects how we define new DCMI terms. The
AM states that the values of all DCMI properties are resources -
people, organisations, concepts, places, etc.</p>

<blockquote><i>"A DCMI metadata value is the physical or conceptual
entity that is associated with a property when it is used to
describe a resource. For example, the value of the DC Creator
property is a person, organisation or service - a physical entitiy.
The value of the DC Date property is a point in time - a conceptual
entity. The value of the DC Coverage property may be a geographic
region or country - a physical entity. The value of the DC Subject
property may be a concept - a conceptual entity - or a physical
object or person - a physical entity. Each of these entities is a
resource. The value may be identified using a value URI; the value
may be represented by one or more value strings and/or rich values;
the value may have some related descriptions - but the value is a
resource."</i></blockquote>

<p>The wording of new DCMI property definitions needs to reflect
this. For example, definitions should <strong>not</strong> use
phrases like "A reference to ..." or "A URI for ...".</p>

<p>Some of the existing terms definitions are poor in this respect.
However, it is probably not possible to change these definitions at
this stage.</p>

<h3>Special case of dcterms:URI</h3>

<p>It is worth noting that 'dcterms:URI' is treated specially in
our syntax encodings. It is used to indicate a <i>value URI</i>
rather than a <i>value string</i>. You'll note that dcterms:URI is
almost never used is the RDF/XML and new XHTML encodings, because
these have alternative mechanisms for indicating that a <i>value
URI</i> is being provided ('rdf:resource' and the XHTML 'link'
element respectively).</p>

<p>Therfore, dcterms:URI is not a normal syntax encoding
scheme.</p>

<h3>Special case of dc:type</h3>

<p>The 'dc:type' property is again a slightly special case w.r.t
the AM because it is used to indicate the class of the resource
being provided.</p>

<p>One might expect little use to be made of 'dc:type' in RDF/XML
encodings, because RDF has separate mechanisms for indicating the
class of a resource.</p>

<h3>Special case of dc:identifier</h3>

<p>Similarily, in combination with 'dcterms:URI', the
'dc:identifier' element can be used to provide the URI of the
resource being described.</p>

<p>Again, one would expect little use to be made of 'dc:identifier'
in the RDF/XML encoding because RDF provides a separate mechanism
for indicating the URI of a resource. The exception to this is
where the identifier being provided cannot be encoded as a URI.</p>

<h3>Element refinement and resource classes</h3>

<p>This is very much an issue on the distant horizon... but
<strong>if</strong> DCMI moves to a position where resources and
values are more strongly typed, for example if we start making more
use of rdfs:domain and rdfs:range in our RDFS term declarations
(this is a big if!), <strong>then</strong> we will have to consider
what impact this has on our notion of <i>element refinement</i>.
For example, I assume that it will be the case that valid element
refinement will only occur when the domain and range of the element
refinement are the same as or narrower than the domain and range of
the element being refined.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary terms as URIs</h3>

<p>When a vocabulary term gets a URI assigned to it, it changes
from being a <i>value string</i> to being a <i>value URI</i> and
the encoding needs to change to reflect that. So for example in
XML, instead of</p>

<pre>
&lt;dc:subject xsi:type="dcterms:DDC"&gt;Internet&lt;/dc:subject&gt;
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
&lt;dc:subject xsi:type="dcterms:DDC"&gt;004.678&lt;/dc:subject&gt;
</pre>

<p>depending on your preference for numbers or words, the encoding
would change to something more like</p>

<pre>
&lt;dc:subject xsi:type="dcterms:URI"&gt;info:ddc/22/eng//004.678&lt;/dc:subject&gt;
</pre>

<p>'DDC' is no longer required as a DCMI encoding scheme because
the DDCness of the value is indicated by the URI. Therefore, there
is no requirement to 'register' DDC with DCMI.</p>

<p>DCMI needs to consider whether it is better to encourage owners
of vocabularies to move towards the use of URIs for their terms, or
continue to encourage the registration of new schemes with DCMI or
to adopt a mixed approach for the time being.</p>

<h3>Vocabulary Encoding Schemes and Syntax Encoding Schemes</h3>

<p>The AM clearly distinguishes between Vocabulary Encoding Schemes
and Synatx Encoding Schemes, because they are fundamentally
different: one provides classes/types of value resources, the other
deals with the format/interpretation of literals. It would appear
that these map exactly onto the distinction between Class and
Datatype in RDF?</p>

<p>DCMI does currently distinguish these things, but I wonder if
that distinction is made forcefully enough in some of our
documentation. It is perhaps worth noting, that the lable
'Vocabulary Encoding Scheme' now looks slightly unfortunate, given
that this is now seen as a mechanism for indicating the class of
the value - however, it may not be sensible or possible to change
our terminology at this point.</p>

<h3>Descriptions, records and schemas/application profiles</h3>

<p>Rachel has pointed out the the AM, as current presented, doesn't
clearly indicate the relationships between descriptions/records and
the schemas (or application profiles) that define those things.</p>

<p>Our current thinking, but this hasn't been agreed with all the
AM authors, is to extend the model slightly, introducing the notion
of a <i>description set</i>. A <i>description set</i> is a
collection of related <i>descriptions</i>. We will replace <i>
record</i> by <i>description set</i> in the current 'description'
model. We will then add a new 'record' model which indicates that a
<i>record</i> is an instantiation of a <i>description set</i> in a
particular encoding syntax.</p>

<p>
This has the advantage of clearly separating the conceptual parts of the model
(the 'resource' model and the 'description' model') from
the instantiated part of the model (the new 'record' model).
</p>

<p>It is important to remember that there are two kinds of schemas
- syntactic and semantic. A <i>syntax schema</i> will be associated
with a <i>record</i> and will define how the syntax is being used.
The most common examples of <i>syntax schemas</i> are those using
the XML schema language. A <i>semantic schema</i>
defines what
classes of resource are being described, which terms are being used
and what their semantics are. The most common examples of <i>
semantic schemas</i> are those using the RDF Schema and OWL
languages.
<i>Semantic schemas</i> are not necessarily tightly bound to anything
in the AM - for example, a <i>semantic schema</i> will commonly be used
to declare all the terms in a particular namespace.
</p>
<p>
In this view, an <i>application profile</i> is a special kind of <i>semantic schema</i>
that is associated with a <i>description set</i>.
The important thing to note is that <i>application profiles</i>
don't need to say anything about syntax, but do need to cover cases
where multiple resources of different classes are being described (e.g. a
document and its author).
</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that, although <i>syntax schemas</i>
are currently bound to <i>records</i> in a formal way (for example, using
xml:schemaLocation), there is no direct linkage between
an <i>application profile</i>
or <i>semantic schema</i>
and a <i>description set</i>. I.e. there is no 'hard line' between these
things and any other entities in the AM.</p>
