<HR><H2><A NAME="section1">1</A>. Introduction</h2>

<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative [<a
href="#dc">DC</a>] is a cross-disciplinary international effort to
develop mechanisms for the discovery-oriented description of
diverse resources in an electronic environment. The Dublin Core Element Set
comprises fifteen elements [<a href="#dces">DCES</a>] which
together capture a representation of essential aspects related to the description of
resources.</p>

<p>The majority of work on the Dublin Core
has addressed the definition of semantics rather than syntax or
structure, allowing rapid conceptual development free of the
constraints imposed by specific implementation environments.
Whilst beneficial in many ways, this has led to a certain lack of
clarity at times, especially in relation to development of 'qualification'
mechanisms which enrich descriptions in the Dublin Core. It has
also made interoperable implementation difficult, as individual
implementors have typically developed their own internal
mechanisms for actually encoding Dublin Core; mechanisms which
are not always compatible with those of their potential
collaborators elsewhere.</p>

<p>A significant number of users currently
implement Dublin Core within the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
[<a href="#html">HTML</a>], the <em>lingua franca</em> of most pages on
the World Wide Web. To this end, a document was recently
published [<a href="#kunze">KUNZE</a>] in order to bring some order to the plethora of
divergent implementations of Dublin Core in HTML. A related document on the expression of richer Qualified Dublin Core within HTML is approaching completion.</p>

<p>The Dublin Core Data Model working group
[<a href="#DCDM">DCDM</a>] was set up to look at means by which the
richness of the Dublin Core model might be expressed outwith the limitations
of HTML. This document represents a technical report on two specific
outcomes from this process; a means by which the model may be
considered, extended, tested and manipulated within the Resource
Description Framework (RDF); and suggested mechanisms by which both
simple and complex Dublin Core might be expressed using the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML), the formal syntax of RDF.
Although RDF is the 'language' used to express the data model,
users are not limited to using only RDF in their own applications.
Similarly, although examples throughout this document are
expressed in XML, this does not mean the Dublin Core may only be
encoded in this way.</p>

<p>The following sections introduce the
building blocks upon which this document relies, such as XML and
RDF. Those who are familiar with these standards may move
directly to <a href="#syntax">A Syntax for the Dublin Core</a>.</p>

<h3><A NAME="section1.1"></A>1.1 Introducing the eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</h3>

<p>The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) [<a
href="#XML-SPEC">XML-SPEC</a>] is a development of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) [<a href="#W3C">W3C</a>], derived from the more complex Standard
Generalised Markup Language (SGML), and aimed specifically at
implementation over the web much as HTML is used today, but with
the possibility of greater richness in both content and
functionality.</p>

<p>In form, an XML document looks much like
one coded in HTML &#151; which
in turn resembles SGML &#151; although certain SGML structural conventions
which were only loosely adopted in HTML have been made mandatory
within a valid XML document.</p>

<p>XML is the syntax chosen to express RDF,
and all of the examples within this paper are represented in XML, validated by the Simple RDF Parser and Compiler (SiRPAC) [<A HREF="#SIRPAC">SIRPAC</A>].</p>

<p>For further information on XML and its
uses, visit the World Wide Web Consortium's XML Home Page [<a
href="#XML">XML</a>].</p>

<h3><A NAME="section1.2"></A>1.2 Introducing the Resource
Description Framework (RDF)</h3>

<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF)
[<a href="#RDF-SPEC">RDF-SPEC</a>] is a further World Wide Web Consortium
initiative, building upon earlier developments such as the Dublin
Core and the Platform for Internet Content Selectivity (PICS) [<A HREF="#PICS">PICS</A>]
content rating initiative [<a href="#ren">IANNELLA</a>].</p>

<p>RDF is an attempt to empower effective
creation, exchange and use of metadata on the World Wide Web, and
therefore addresses many of the same issues as the Dublin Core.
Unlike the Dublin Core, however, RDF makes few assumptions about <em>semantics</em>
whilst instead defining a coherent <em>structure</em> (for the expression of semantics) and
recommending a powerful transport <em>syntax</em> in the form of
XML [<a href="#XML-SPEC">XML-SPEC</a>]. As such, the combination of structure and
syntax offered by RDF in XML is a suitable complement to the
semantically rich Dublin Core element set, and the three can be
used together to good effect, as demonstrated by this document.</p>

<p>The basic premise behind RDF is a simple
one; that an identifiable, addressable 'resource' may be
described by means of a selection of 'properties' (size, name,
maker, etc.), each of which has an associated 'value'
(23 x 45 cm, Moonlight over Columbus, Fred Bloggs, etc.). In
certain cases, the statement of a 'property' may, in itself,
form a further 'resource', allowing the model to grow,
potentially infinitely, by linking information resources together.</p>

<a name="above"><p>As stated above</a>, XML provides the default syntax used
to encode RDF descriptions, and numerous examples of
this may be seen later in the paper. At times, it can aid clarity
to express RDF descriptions in a diagrammatic form, allowing the
distinction between resources, properties and values to
become clear. At their most basic, such diagrams take the form
demonstrated below.</p>
<p align=center>
<A NAME="figure1"></A>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
text="#000000">
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><b>Figure 1: A simple RDF assertion</b></td></tr></tr>
        <td><img src="figure1.gif" width="344" height="83"></td>
    </tr>
</table>
</P>
<p>Here, a 'resource', <TT>http://doc</TT>, has a 'property',
author, describing some aspect of it. The value of the 'property'
is Joe Smith. In other words, Joe Smith is the author of <tt>http://doc</tt>.</p>

<p>In this diagrammatic form, resources are
always represented as ovals. Properties are always represented by
arrows which point from the subject of any statement to the
object of the statement (Joe Smith is the author of the resource.
The resource is <EM>not</EM> the author of Joe Smith). Where the statement
is simply a text string (like &quot;Joe Smith&quot;), it is shown
in a rectangular box. In cases where the statement is itself a
resource, the statement is represented as an oval which may, in
turn, point to further properties, statements and resources.</p>

<p>Presented in XML, the diagram above
would be coded as follows, the individual elements of the XML
being described further, below.</p>

<p align="center">
<A NAME="example1"></A>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
text="#000000">

        <td align=center><b>Example 1: A simple RDF assertion</b></td></tr>
        <tr><td>

       &lt;author&gt; Joe Smith &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<h3><A NAME="section1.3"></A>1.3 Introducing XML Namespaces</h3>

<p>The great power of both XML and RDF is
the ability for individual content providing communities to
declare their own modes of expression for the description of
resources of importance to them. However, rather than having each
community develop a comprehensive system describing all
aspects of their resources, XML and RDF offer a more
interoperable foundation whereby a single description may comprise
elements drawn from any number of accessible recording practices.
It therefore becomes possible, for example, for all communities
to <em>share</em> the notion of 'authorship' and use the same
element for describing this notion, whilst one community then
makes use of its own subject classification system and another
embeds complex date-related information.</p>

<p>The means by which this rich yet
interoperable diversity is facilitated is known as the XML
Namespace [<a href="#XML-NAME">XML-NAME</a>], a construct which is adopted in RDF.</p>

<p>At it's most basic, an XML Namespace may
be seen as providing human and computer-parseable context for any
resource description element. The term, Creator, for example,
means a variety of things to different communities. If it were
clear, though, that this were the Dublin Core element, <TT>Creator</TT>,
then the semantics of the element and its contents become
somewhat clearer.</p>

<p>By using a globally unique assertion such as <TT>http://purl.org.dc.elements/1.0/creator</TT> to unambiguously
identify this concept, XML/RDF allows terms in a metadata vocabulary to be treated as reliably describable
objects. This further lays the foundations by which interrelationships between terms and concepts from competing
structures may be expressed. Additionally, these unique associations of terms (in any language) with a single authoritative object provide impetus to much of the internationalisation work currently underway within the Dublin Core process [<A HREF="#DC-INTERNAT">DC-INTERNAT</A>], as a label (in French, say) may be linked with the authoritative definition of its associated element as viewed by the Dublin Core community.</p>

<p>In order to differentiate between terms
drawn from different descriptive paradigms, or 'namespaces', the
XML Namespace mechanism requires that all elements not core to
basic XML be preceded by a shorthand identification of the
namespace from which they originate. To make it clear that
Creator is the Dublin Core element, it would therefore be
preceded by '<TT>dc:</TT>'. XML is case sensitive, making it important
that '<TT>dc:</TT>' be entered consistently as '<TT>dc:</TT>', '<TT>Dc:</TT>', '<TT>DC:</TT>' and '<TT>dC:</TT>'
would normally be interpreted as shorthands for four totally different namespaces.</p>

<p>To make the human-interpretable link
between '<TT>dc:</TT>' and the Dublin Core intelligible to a piece of
software, RDF descriptions in which the XML Namespace constructs
are used begin with a declaration of the namespaces to be used,
the location at which they may be resolved by appropriate
software, and the abbreviated form by which they may be
recognised throughout the RDF description to follow.</p>

<p>To associate '<TT>dc:</TT>' with the Dublin Core, for
example, an RDF description expressed in XML might begin</p>

<pre>&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;
     xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>When resolved, suitably enabled software
would unpack this statement in order to turn <TT>dc:creator</TT> into &lt;URL: <a
href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/creator"><TT>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/creator</TT></a>&gt;, and by following the link both human and
machine may be able to decode the meaning of this element.</p>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section2"></A>2. <a name="syntax">A syntax for the Dublin Core</a></h2>

<p>From the outset, development of the
Dublin Core element set [<a href="#DCES">DCES</a>] has been
primarily concerned with the evolution of semantics for the
description of resources. Syntax has, to a large extent, been
left to individual implementors, allowing the community as a
whole to remain focussed upon defining effective semantics for
the Core.</p>

<p>The development of RDF provides
an environment in which the semantic ideals of Dublin Core may be
both preserved and expressed, whilst allowing the simultaneous
definition of a syntax utilising the eXtensible Markup Language (XML).
A range of other syntaxes may continue to be used by implementors
of the Dublin Core, however only the combination of
RDF and XML currently offers the range of capabilities required to fully
express the richness of both qualified and unqualified Dublin
Core in an unambiguous manner.</p>

<h3><A NAME="section2.1"></A>2.1 <a name="DC-NAMESPACE">The Dublin Core Namespace</a></h3>

<p>As discussed above, XML's concept of
Namespaces [<a href="#XML-NAME">XML-NAME</a>] is utilised in RDF in order to allow different
communities to develop their own means of resource discovery, and
for individual descriptions to select from one or more of these
community-specific frameworks as required.</p>

<p>The fifteen basic elements of the Dublin
Core Element Set [<a href="#DCES">DCES</a>] as defined by <a
href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2413.txt">RFC 2413</a> may be
considered to comprise a single Namespace, the encoding of which
is demonstrated in <a href="#APP-ONE">Appendix 1</a>, and
available for reference on the World Wide Web at &lt;URL: <a
href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/"><TT>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/</TT></a>&gt;.</p>

<p>Although it is permissible to use any
character string to identify this Namespace in a description, the Data Model
group recommends use of the lower case '<TT>dc:</TT>'.</p>

<h3><A NAME="section2.2"></A><A NAME="SECTION-2.2">2.2 Encoding Dublin Core in RDF with XML</A></h3>

<h4><A NAME="section2.2.1"></A>2.2.1 Essential elements of an XML-encoded
Dublin Core description</h4>

<p>Users who intend to code XML by hand, or
write applications which make use of it, should familiarise themselves with the XML specification [<a
href="#XML-SPEC">XML-SPEC</a>], and with some of the tools and introductory
texts for XML that are beginning to appear. Although no
substitute for a more detailed grounding in XML, this section
offers a number of reminders to key elements of any well formed
XML document. In ensuring that documents remain well formed, users are pointed to the emerging range of XML validation tools, such as 'Are You Well Formed?' (RUWF) [<A HREF="#RUWF">RUWF</A>].</p>

<h5><A NAME="section2.2.1.1"></A>2.2.1.1 XML version declaration</h5>

<p>Any well-formed XML document will
include a statement of the version of XML used. At present, the
only valid version of XML, as defined in the W3C Recommendation [<a
href="#XML-SPEC">XML-SPEC</a>], is 1.0. Documents should therefore include the
statement</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;</pre>

<p>on their first line.</p>

<h5><A NAME="section2.2.1.2"></A>2.2.1.2 Declaring the use of RDF</h5>

<p>It is necessary to declare that RDF is
being used, as this brings extra functionality and constraints to
a basic XML document. This is done by including</p>

<pre>
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>as the first line of an RDF description;
normally on the line following the XML version declaration. The
RDF description must then be closed by appending</p>

<pre>
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>

<p>to the end.</p>

<p>As any description of Dublin Core in RDF
will require the use of at least the <a
href="#DC-NAMESPACE">Dublin Core Namespace</a>, this statement will normally be expanded to
become</p>

<pre>
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;
         xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>This expanded statement clearly informs
both users and applications that RDF is being used, and may be
recognised within this portion of the document by the prefix '<TT>rdf:</TT>'.  Additionally, Dublin Core is being
used and may be recognised within this portion of the document by the prefix '<TT>dc:</TT>'. The RDF
description must still be closed through use of</p>

<pre>
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</pre>

after which the definitions of the namespaces become meaningless unless declared again in a new block of RDF.

<h5><A NAME="section2.2.1.3"></A>2.2.1.3 Preserving case in element
names</h5>

<p>In XML, the case used in element names
is extremely important, such that '<TT>Creator</TT>', '<TT>creator</TT>', '<TT>CREATOR</TT>'
and '<TT>cREATOR</TT>' are interpreted as four totally different elements.</p>

<p>The Data Model group defines element names
expressed wholly in lower case to be best practice (so '<TT>creator</TT>',
<em>not</em> '<TT>Creator</TT>', '<TT>CREATOR</TT>' or '<TT>cREATOR</TT>'), and this
convention must be used where links are made to the <a
href="#DC-NAMESPACE">Dublin Core Namespace</a>.</p>

<p>This statement of best practice applies
only to Dublin Core element names expressed as part of a URI (such
as <TT>dc:creator</TT>, which software might expand to &lt;URL: <A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/creator"><TT>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/creator</TT></A>&gt;), and has no bearing upon the use of element
names in contexts where they are only to be read by human beings.</p>

<h5><A NAME="section2.2.1.4"></A>2.2.1.4 XML tags must close</h5>

<p>HTML was rather flexible in it's
interpretation of SGML's tagging rules, such that it was possible
to use tags (such as <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT>)
without closing them (with <TT>&lt;/P&gt;</TT> in
this example).</p>

<p>In XML, a document will only be
considered valid if all tags display both a start tag <TT>&lt;TAG&gt;</TT> and an end tag <TT>&lt;/TAG&gt;</TT> in
all cases.</p>

<h5><A NAME="section2.2.1.5"></A>2.2.1.5 Empty tags</h5>

<p>XML supports the notion of 'empty' tags,
which are used for a number of purposes. In these cases, a short hand
notation may be adopted, permitting the replacement of <TT>&lt;TAG&gt; &lt;/TAG&gt;</TT> with <TT>&lt;TAG /&gt;</TT>.
This shorthand notation is frequently used in RDF, and is
especially useful when it comes to encoding elements of a
qualified Dublin Core Description, as discussed in <a
href="#SECTION-THREE">Section 3</a>. <A HREF="#section2.3">Section 2.3</A> also illustrates use of these empty tags for RDF's <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#abbreviatedSyntax">abbreviated syntax</A>, where the bulk of the description is stored inside an empty <TT>&lt;rdf:Description /&gt;</TT> tag.</p>

<h4><A NAME="section2.2.2"></A>2.2.2 A useful by-product: <TT>xml:lang</TT></h4>

<P>An advantage of using an established syntax such as XML is that it provides certain extra tools and features that the Dublin Core community would otherwise need to develop separately.</P>

<P>It has long been argued, for example, that a need exists to identify the language in which a piece of metadata is expressed. This language may well be different from the language of the <EM>resource</EM> being described, which can be entered in the Dublin Core's Language element, but is often vital to the resource discovery process.</P>

<P>Catalogued in a German search engine, for example, this document would still be in English, but its title may be given in German to aid discovery by German speakers. Dublin Core provides the ability, via <TT>&lt;dc:language&gt;</TT>, to express the language of the document itself. XML, via the <TT>&lt;xml:lang&gt;</TT> declaration [<A HREF="#xml-lang">XML-LANG</A>], provides the ability to identify the languages in which individual elements of metadata are expressed, and the Dublin Core data model simply utilises this mechanism. See <A HREF="#example13">Example 13</A> for an example of metadata expressed in different languages.</P>

<H4><A NAME="section2.2.3"></A>2.2.3 Examples</H4>

As illustrated <A HREF="#above">above</A>, XML encodings of RDF can be very simple to construct. The earlier example is repeated here:
<P>
<A NAME="example2"></A>
<P align="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
text="#000000">
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><b>Example 2</b></td></tr><tr>
        <td>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://doc&quot;&gt;
       &lt;author&gt; Joe Smith &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</P>
</P>

In order to represent Dublin Core in an XML expression of RDF, only two small changes are required. Firstly, use of Dublin Core must be stated by means of a Namespace declaration, and secondly the element, <TT>author</TT>, must be replaced with a Dublin Core element. The example may then be restated as:
<P>
<A NAME="example3"></A>
<P align="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"
text="#000000">
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><b>Example 3</b></td></tr><tr>
        <td>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
     xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;
     xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://doc&quot;&gt;
    &lt;dc:creator&gt; Joe Smith &lt;/dc:creator&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</P>
</P>

In a more complete example, the metadata for this document might be presented, thus:
<P>
<A NAME="example4"></A>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section3"></A>3. <a name="SECTION-THREE">Enriching the Dublin Core</a></h2>

<p>The discussion, above, includes all of
the information required to implement <a
href="http://info.internet.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc2413.txt">RFC 2413</a>-compliant
Dublin Core in RDF. However, the wider Dublin Core community has
long sought to increase the richness of their descriptions
through the use of qualification and substructure. Due to the
manner in which these extensions to the basic fifteen elements
evolved, a number of solutions arose, with current
implementations including such notions as 'scheme', 'type' and
'subelement', and the majority of coding solutions involving the
use of convoluted pseudo-hierarchical strings such as <TT>DC.Creator.personalName</TT>, etc.</p>

<p>Many of these current solutions work,
but they are based upon a series of compromises and coded in a
far from logical manner. The use of RDF allows clarification of the meaning of this substructuring, prior to
offering a sound means of representing it in XML/RDF.</p>

<h3><A NAME="section3.1"></A>3.1 <a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>

<p>There has been a tremendous amount of discussion regarding the
types of qualification most useful to the
range of communities represented in the Dublin Core process.
The following list is an attempt to capture some
of the different requirements which
have emerged:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Rather than entering a string of
        numbers or letters into an element, it is
        useful to have the ability to identify the coding system
        utilised. It is useful, for example, to be able to add
        value to the string '<TT>1999-04-12</TT>' by unambiguously
        associating it with the ISO 8601 date format, whereby it
        becomes clear that the date refers to the 12th of April
        and not the 4th of December. In early Dublin Core
        implementations, this was done by means of the 'Scheme'
        qualifier to an element.</li>
    <li>Many of the Dublin Core elements
        encompass broad concepts or topics, such as the creator
        of a resource. It is perceived as useful to semantically
        refine such elements in order to say that someone is the
        illustrator of a resource, and that illustrator is a
        refinement of creator. In early Dublin Core
        implementations, this was done by means of the 'Subelement'
        qualification of an element, often by means of a pseudo-hierarchical
        dot notation (<TT>DC.Creator.Illustrator</TT>, for example).</li>
    <li>Regardless of relationships between described concepts &#151; such as the relationship between an author, Joe, and the resource he wrote &#151; it is frequently important to describe class-type relationships to other concepts or resources. Totally unrelated to his author relationship to a resource, for example, Joe remains a person. He would be a person even if he didn't write the resource being described, or any other resource. This fact might usefully be described by declaring him to be a member of a class, person,  distinct from other creative agents who might equally be described as authors, such as corporate bodies or manufactured instruments like a satellite sensor. </li>
    <li>Despite its wide-ranging nature,
        the Dublin Core Element Set was not intended to allow detailed
        description of all aspects of any resource. It is often
        therefore necessary for implementors to use additional metadata vocabularies alongside the Dublin Core Element Set in order to meet
        their local needs. Conceptually, this is covered by early
        work on the Warwick Framework [<a href="#LAGOZE">LAGOZE</a>],
        whilst most practical implementations simply added their
        own elements to the Core (<TT>MyElement.AgeRange</TT>, for example) in order to address
        aspects of this need in a less than ideal fashion.</li>
    <li>In a number of cases, users
        perceive the need to further subdivide and categorise
        values inserted into Dublin Core elements. 'Joe Smith',
        for example, is a valid value in the Creator element.
        Users might wish, though, to identify 'Joe' as this
        individual's first name and 'Smith' has his surname, and
        to state that his e-mail address is 'joe@home.net'. In
        early Dublin Core implementations, this was done by means
        of the 'Subelement' qualification of an element, often by
        means of a pseudo-hierarchical dot notation (<TT>DC.Creator.PersonalName.Email</TT>, <TT>DC.Creator.PersonalName.Forename</TT>
, <TT>DC.Creator.PersonalName.Surname</TT>, for example).</li>
</ul>

<h3><A NAME="section3.2"></A>3.2 Qualification Components</h3>

<p>In considering the ways in which a
Dublin Core element might usefully be qualified or enhanced, it
became clear to the Data Model group that the existing
possibilities through such constructs as Schemes, Types and
Subelements served only to confuse, with similar tasks often
being tackled by means of different solutions. Rather than
attempting to represent the current structure in RDF, the Data
Model group considered the needs of qualification in the abstract
and evolved a suitable solution to Dublin Core's requirements.
This solution is outlined below, and may be easily mapped to
existing implementations of Dublin Core substructure and
qualification.</p>

<p>Use of the confusing term 'Subelement' is deprecated as a label for aspects of element qualification.</p>

<p>Examined in the abstract, it became
clear that qualification takes two main forms in Dublin Core
applications; those qualifiers that refine or enhance the meaning
of the <em>element</em> (totally hypothetically, 'modification
date' might be a refinement of the Dublin Core element, Date),
and those that refine or enhance the interpretation of the <em>value</em>
(knowing that '<TT>1999-04-12</TT>' is encoded according to the rules of
ISO 8601 greatly enhances a reader's ability to interpret the
value, as it becomes clear that the twelfth day of April is being
expressed, rather than the fourth day of December).</p>

<p>The basic model for qualifying Dublin Core can be represented
graphically in the following diagram. As well as the rectangular box (representing a text string) and oval (representing a resource) introduced previously, this diagram makes use of a pentagon to demonstrate cases in which the arrow may point at either a text string or a resource whilst remaining valid.</P>

<P>For the sake of interoperability, and to enable future enhancement of these resource descriptions, it is strongly recommended that use of simple text strings be deprecated in favour of properly addressable resources. i.e., a URI locating the term, illustrator, within an online thesaurus or controlled terminology is preferable to use of the text string, &quot;illustrator&quot;.</p>

<ul>
    <li><A NAME="section3.2.1"></A><h4>3.2.1 Resource</h4>
        <p><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other resources.  Not all resources are network "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be considered resources.&quot;<br>[<A HREF="#rfc2396">RFC2396</A>]</BLOCKQUOTE>

        </p>
<P>Importantly, a resource in RDF must always be identifiable by means of a URI of some kind.</P>
    </li>
    <li><h4><A NAME="section3.2.2"></A>3.2.2 Element</h4>
        <p>An element is a specific
        characteristic or attribute of a resource. An element, in terms of the RDF
        data model [<a
        href="#RDF-SPEC">RDF-SPEC</a>], is analogous to a property.
        Each element (or property) defined by the Dublin Core
        community has a specific semantic meaning and may define
        its permitted values, the types of resources it can
        describe, and its relationship with other elements. The
        Dublin Core Element Set [<a
        href="#DCES">DCES</a>] defines a set properties and
        associated semantics common to many resource description
        communities.<br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4><A NAME="section3.2.3"></A>3.2.3 Literal</h4>
        <p>Literals are simple text
        strings. Literals may have structured content (e.g. XML
        markup) but are not further evaluated by the RDF processor. There are some
        syntactic restrictions on how markup in literals may be
        expressed; see <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-rdf-syntax/#quoting">Section
        2.2.1</a> in the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">RDF Model and
        Syntax Specification</a>.<br>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4><A NAME="section3.2.4"></A>3.2.4
        Element Qualifiers</h4>
        <p>Element qualifiers are the solution
        proposed in order to meet the requirement (identified <a
        href="#requirements">above</a>) of many implementors to specify aspects
        of a given resource with greater precision than is
        offered by the fifteen Dublin Core elements. Element
        Qualifiers would, for example, allow the broad concept of
        date (handled within Dublin Core's Date element) to be
        further subdivided into (hypothetically) date of creation,
        date of last modification, etc.</p>
        <p>Element Qualifiers correspond
        loosely to the notion of 'types' or 'subelements' in some
        early implementations of the Dublin Core.</p>
        <p>An Element Qualifier
        refines the semantics of a
        Dublin Core element to further specify the relationship
        of the element to the resource itself. The Element
        Qualifier does not change the definition of the element,
        nor does it modify the value. Recommended practice is to
        use an Element Qualifier from a controlled list of
        Element Qualifier Terms defined for that element or from
        a domain specific list approved and maintained by a
        particular community.<br>
        </p>
        <h5><A NAME="section3.2.4.1"></A>3.2.4.1 Element Qualifier Terms</h5>
        <p>Element Qualifier Terms
        represent permissible values for any given Element
        Qualifier. By separating the generic enabling mechanisms
        (the Element Qualifiers) from the actual qualifications
        themselves (the Element Qualifier Terms) it remains
        possible to provide guidance on the ways in which
        qualification should be undertaken without the necessity
        to create an all-encompassing set of terms from which all
        communities should select.</p>
        <p>For example, the ability to
        qualify the Date element is widely accepted by Dublin
        Core implementors. The need for a specific type of Date
        recording the date of accession is not so universal. The
        generic (community-wide) Element Qualifier might
        therefore be <TT>dateType</TT>,
        whilst one implementation permits the locally useful
        Element Qualifier Term <TT>accessioned</TT> to be used along with this Element
        Qualifier.</p>
        <p>The manner in which this
        extensibility mechanism works is illustrated in the <a
        href="#examples">Examples</a>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><h4><A NAME="section3.2.5"></A>3.2.5 Value Qualifiers</h4>
        <p>Value Qualifiers are the solution
        proposed in order to meet the requirement (identified <a
        href="#requirements">above</a>) of many implementors to specify the
        manner in which a value is encoded, normally with
        reference to some list of controlled terms or to a set of
        parsing rules. Value Qualifiers would, for example, allow
        the Date, 1999-04-12, to be unambiguously associated with
        the ISO 8601 standard for expressing dates; thus making
        it clear that the 12th of April is being described,
        rather than the 4th of December. </p>
        <p>Value Qualifiers correspond
        loosely to the notion of 'schemes' in some early
        implementations of the Dublin Core.</p>
        <p>A Value Qualifier refers to the
        value, specifying either an encoding rule or a
        controlled vocabulary to aid in interpreting the value.
        Recommended practice is to use a Value Qualifier
        generally understood by the target community, or a
        standard encoding or parsing scheme in wide use across
        communities.</p>
        <h5><A NAME="section3.2.5.1"></A>3.2.5.1 Value Qualifier Terms</h5>
        <p>Value Qualifier Terms represent
        permissible values for any given Value Qualifier. By
        separating the generic enabling mechanisms (the Value
        Qualifiers) from the actual qualifications themselves (the
        Value Qualifier Terms) it remains possible to provide
        guidance on the ways in which qualification should be
        undertaken without the necessity to create an all-encompassing
        set of terms from which all communities should select.</p>
        <p>For example, the ability to
        identify the encoding used for values in the Date element
        is widely accepted by Dublin Core implementors. The need
        for specific reference to encoding in the Gregorian
        calendar is not so universal. The generic (community-wide)
        Value Qualifier might therefore be <TT>dateScheme</TT>, whilst one implementation permits the
        locally useful Value Qualifier Term <TT>Gregorian</TT> to be used along with this Value
        Qualifier.</p>
        <p>The manner in which this
        extensibility mechanism works is illustrated in the <a
        href="#examples">Examples</font></a>.</p>
    </li>

<h4><A NAME="section3.2.6"></A>3.2.6 Intermediate Nodes</h4>
<p>The central oval in <A HREF="#figure2">Figure 2</A> is known as an 'Intermediate Node', and is the diagrammatic means by which a series of related statements are grouped together. Unlike named resources (those with some form of label text inside the oval), these intermediate nodes do not represent tangible or identifiable resources.</P>

<P>Represented in the XML syntax (see <A HREF="#example8">Example 8</A> for illustration), the group of values pointed to from one of these 'Intermediate Nodes' would be gathered within a single <TT>&lt;RDF:Description...&gt;</TT> instance.</P>

<h4><A NAME="section3.2.7"></A>3.2.7 Value Components</h4>
<P>Although not represented in <A HREF="#figure2">Figure 2</A>, Value Components are an important part of the Dublin Core model, allowing pieces of a resource description to be grouped together and identified as aspects &#151; or components &#151; of some whole independent of the resource being described.</P>

<P>Value Components are semantic characteristics (e.g. the name, hair colour, eye colour and social security number of a person) of a value.  These characteristics may be drawn from existing vocabularies or defined within specific communities. Value Components are intrinsic to the value regardless of its relationship to a particular resource.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="#example11">Example 11</A> for one instance of a Value Component.</P>

<h3><A NAME="section3.3"></A>3.3 Repetition</h3>

<p>In many applications, the
repetition and grouping of elements or
their values is desirable. RDF provides useful constructs
for such grouping[<a
href="#RDF-SPEC">RDF-SPEC</a>]. These include: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Bag: </b>An unordered list of resources or literals.
        Bags are used to declare that a property has multiple
        values and that there is no significance to the order in
        which the values are given. Bag might be used to give a
        list of part numbers where the order of processing the
        parts does not matter. Duplicate values are permitted.</li>
    <li><b>Sequence: </b>An ordered list of resources or literals.
        Sequence is used to declare that a property has multiple
        values and that the order of the values is significant.
        Sequence might be used, for example, to preserve an
        alphabetical ordering of values. Duplicate values are
        permitted.</li>
    <li><b>Alternative: </b>A list of resources or literals that
        represent alternatives for the (single) value of a
        property. Alternative might be used to provide
        alternative language translations for the title of a work,
        or to provide a list of Internet mirror sites at which a
        resource might be found. An application using a property
        whose value is an Alternative collection is aware that it
        can choose any one of the items in the list as
        appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of these constructs (when appropriate) is encouraged when repeating
elements, values, element qualifiers and value qualifiers, and may be seen in <A HREF="#example13">Example 13</A>. </p>

</ul>

<h3><A NAME="section3.4"></A>3.4 Managing complexity; introducing the 'dumb-down principle'</h3>

<p>In a heterogeneous environment such as that in which the Dublin Core operates, it is necessary to offer a means by which perceived over-complexity may be handled. Such a need is manifested in cases where users or software expecting 'simple' Dublin Core (as described in <A HREF="#syntax">Section 2</A>) encounter 'qualified' Dublin Core (as described in <A HREF="#SECTION-THREE">Section 3</A>), as well as in situations where users or software able to handle 'qualified' Dublin Core encounter terminology from additional namespaces with which they are unfamiliar, and which they do not wish to resolve through reference to the namespace declaration itself.</p>

<p>In both cases, a clear and unambiguous mechanism is required by which the acceptable values (unqualified text in the first example, and values only from understood namespaces in the second) may be extracted from the Description in such a way that intelligible results are obtained without significant loss of value.</p>

<p>Expressed in English, the mechanism proposed is that tools simply ignore any resources originating from intermediate structural nodes in the node-and-arc diagram, and follow the chain of <TT>rdf:value</TT> arcs until they terminate in a character string. The content of that character string is then returned as the value of the Dublin Core element.</p>

In order to enable the smooth manipulation of 'simple' Dublin Core in 'qualified' systems <EM>and </EM>effective handling of 'qualified' in 'simple' systems, it is necessary to ensure the following;

<ul>
<li>A Dublin Core tool <EM>must </EM>understand the Dublin Core namespace, <TT>dc:</TT>, and the RDF namespace, <TT>rdf:</TT>. Understanding <TT>rdf:</TT> provides an understanding of the mechanisms for extracting unualified Dublin Core values from a qualified Dublin Core description.</li>
<li><EM>Every </EM>description validly expressed in unqualified Dublin Core is considered to be a valid description in qualified Dublin Core.</li>
<li>Systems capable of interpreting qualified Dublin Core <EM>must not</EM>, when presented with a valid unqualified description, add anything to that description during parsing. There are no default qualifiers for the Dublin Core elements, and none should be assumed.</li>
</ul>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section4"></A>4. Partitioning Qualification:
Namespaces</h2>

<p>The metadata ecology of the Internet will be partitioned into
many modular niches, each targeted to particular functions or
communities. Such niches are often represented as <em>namespaces</em>,
or controlled vocabularies. XML (the underlying encoding idiom of
RDF) provides a native namespace facility that is useful for
partitioning authority for the management of such element sets
and their qualifiers. </p>

<p>The 15 elements of the Dublin Core represent a namespace of
bounded function (resource discovery). The combination of the
namespace token (conventionally, <TT>dc:</TT> has been used for Dublin
Core) and an element name identifies a defined description field
of clearly defined scope. The syntactic conventions for
unambiguously identifying the namespace are provided by the
namespace declaration of XML [<a href="#XML-NAME">XML-NAME</a>]. </p>

<p>In the Dublin Core namespace the semantics of 15 elements are
defined. In order to be explicit when combining semantics from
multiple namespaces, the namespace identifier token (i.e. '<TT>dc:</TT>')
is prepended to these elements in
order to uniquely identify each element. Thus the element <tt>&lt;dc:title&gt;</tt>
could be interpreted as &lt;URL: <tt><A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/title">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/title</A></tt>&gt;
or <em>&quot;the 'Title' as defined by the Dublin Core Community&quot;,
</em> and could be resolved by either the
human reader or by a suitable software agent upon looking up the
reference definition formed by the URL.</p>

<p>The requirement for additional substructure for the Dublin
Core elements and the permissible terms or values associated with
this substructure has been evident from the inception of the
Dublin Core. The Data Model Working Group is persuaded that these
additional qualifiers and qualifying mechanisms should be managed under a separate, but
closely related namespace of Dublin Core Qualifiers. Thus, the semantic declaration of the 15
elements will be managed in a
particular namespace (<tt>dc:</tt>), and generic
qualifying mechanisms promoted by the Dublin Core community will
be managed in an additional namespace (<tt>dcq:</tt>) available to those in need of the extra
functionality it offers.</p>

<p>Finally, a non-exclusive set of commonly
used terms and values might additionally be defined in the
<tt>dct:</tt> namespace. </p>

<p>Users and implementors are therefore
free to adopt and support the basic Dublin Core (as represented by <TT>dc:</TT>) on its own. Additionally, they may choose to
embrace the extensibility mechanisms offered through <TT>dcq:</TT>. Finally, those using <TT>dcq:</TT> are further able to
make use of commonly requested terms and values within the <TT>dct:</TT> namespace, and/or to utilise their own lists.</p>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section5"></A>5. Qualification Mechanisms: The
DCQ Namespace</h2>

<p>The basic definition of the fifteen
Dublin Core elements [<a href="#DCES">DCES</a>] enshrined
in the Dublin Core Namespace, <TT>dc:</TT>, is
sufficient to enable creation of and interaction with Dublin Core
metadata descriptions compliant with RFC 2413.</p>

<p>In order to support qualification of these
elements, Element Qualifiers and
Value Qualifiers associated with
each of the elements must be defined. The Dublin Core Qualifier
Namespace (<TT>dcq:</TT>) at &lt;URL: <A HREF="http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/"><TT>http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/</TT></A>&gt;
has been reserved for these declarations.
The following table reflects these declarations. </p>

<p>The RDF instance of this declaration
can be found in <A HREF="#appendix2">Appendix 2</A>, although users
and developers should always refer to the Namespace itself for
the most definitive version. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that the following are the machine readable &#151; and often effectively invisible &#151; Element Qualifiers; the human readable labels
are application specific, and will
frequently be more user friendly in terminology.</p>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section6"></A>6. <a name="ValueTerm">Value
Terms</a>: The DCT Namespace</h2>

<p>Implementation experience has shown that,
whatever their background, the majority of implementors tend to
come up with lists of qualifying values for the Dublin Core in
which there is significant overlap with those lists developed by
others.</p>

<p>Whilst not intending to constrict the
ways in which implementors may link to their own terminologies
utilising the enabling mechanisms provided by the <TT>dcq:</TT> Namespace, the Data Model group was keen to
provide a means of allowing easy access to these commonly used
qualifications in order to promote widespread interoperability.</p>

<p>The Dublin Core Terms Namespace (<TT>dct:</TT>) at &lt;URL: <TT>http://purl.org/dc/terms/1.0/</TT>&gt; has been reserved
for these declarations, and the terms themselves are under
discussion within the Dublin Core Working Group process.</p>

<h3><A NAME="section7.6"></A>7.6 Example 12</h3>

<p>The following example reflects the statement
that a specific, uniquely identifiable person is the creator of the resource <TT>http://doc</TT>. This
person has characteristics (which are defined by another
community, in this case VCARD [<A HREF="#VCARD">VCARD</A>]) which include a name &quot;Joe Smith&quot;
and email address &quot;joe@my.com&quot; and an affiliation
&quot;My Company, Inc.&quot;.</p>

<P>In this case, the 'Joe Smith' in question is being identified in a less ambiguous manner than in previous examples. A hypothetical 'directory enquiries' service is being demonstrated using the 411.com URI, whereby the individual, Joe Smith, is associated with a single URI that might &#151; or might not &#151; provide such details as social security number, current employer, address, etc. Alternative URI's might include a link to a specific individual's entry in a corporate X.500 database or their social security or national insurance number, suitably qualified with an appropriate namespace declaration, all of which serve to allow a near-explicit declaration of which Joe Smith (out of the thousands likely to exist) is being described.</P>

<P>It is important to note that the 411.com URI is <EM>not</EM> the URI of Joe Smith's home page on the web, as it is unreasonable to suggest that an individual's personal home page could be considered to represent them in this fashion. Rather, the URI points to no more than a means by which the individual may be identified in as unambiguous a fashion as possible.</P>

<p>The value of <TT>creatorType</TT>
utilised in this example, <tt>dct:illustrator</tt>, has not yet been formally approved by the
Dublin Core community, and is included for demonstration purposes
only. This is an example of a <a href="#ValueTerm">Value Term</a>, and
the definitive list of terms is currently under development
within the Working Group process. Also, the notion of a class, 'person',
is proposed by the Data Model Group, but the exact method by
which it will be implemented has yet to be agreed. Its use in this example should therefore be considered experimental at this time.</p>

<p>The VCARD Namespace proposed in this
example remains hypothetical, although discussions are underway
in order to make it reality.</p>

<P>The following example illustrates a more complete record, in this case a description of this document.

<P>In grouping the editors' names, the <TT>&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#containers">rdf:Bag</A>&gt;</TT> structure is used to indicate collective editorship of the document (i.e. that the three editors are related to the report as a group, rather than as individuals). Note that both this <TT>&lt;rdf:Bag&gt;</TT> structure and the repeating of <TT>&lt;dc:creator&gt;</TT> as in <A HREF="#example4">Example 4</A> are syntactically valid RDF, but the approach taken here is preferred as any possible ambiguity as to the relationship between the editors is removed.

<P>A second RDF <A HREF="#section3.3">grouping mechanism</A> is also used in this example, to offer alternative languages for some of the metadata. Use of <TT>&lt;xml:lang&gt;</TT> in this fashion is discussed in <A HREF="#section2.2.2">Section 2.2.2</A>.</P>

<P>Note the addition of an encoding statement to the XML version declaration on the first line. This statement is necessary to allow correct display of the 'foreign' characters in the multilingual text.</P>

<HR><H2><A NAME="section8"></A>8. Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the increasing availability of electronic information in a plethora of forms, the need for an effective means by which these resources might be described grows ever greater.</P>

<p>Existing mechanisms to describe particular forms of resource within individual communities continue to improve, but the need is most pressing between and across communities, as the barriers of old become less relevant to a modern information society and scholars attempt to move seamlessly across these communities on the trail of subject-spanning concepts and issues.
<P>
Originally developed from very separate ideas, the current convergence of the concepts behind Dublin Core with the syntactic and structural facilities offered by XML and RDF offers a powerful weapon in the arsenal of those manipulating and using the wealth of information with which we are surrounded.
<P>
Dublin Core offers a means by which diverse resources might be described for discovery in an interdisciplinary context, and XML/RDF provides the structure for unambiguous expression of this Dublin Core information, as well as the straightforward addition of more detailed descriptions from the communities concerned.<P>

<p>Documents forthcoming from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative will serve to clarify the model upon which these potentials are based, and will begin to illustrate the manner in which Dublin Core-based metadata acts as a key capable of unlocking the riches of many disciplinary treasure chests.</P>

    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Author/Creator&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The person or organization primarily responsible for
    creating the intellectual content of the resource. For example,
    authors in the case of written documents, artists, photographers, or
    illustrators in the case of visual resources.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;subject&quot;&gt;

    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Subject&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be
    expressed as keywords or phrases that describe the subject or
    content of the resource. The use of controlled vocabularies and
    formal classification schemes is encouraged.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;description&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Description&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; A textual description of the content of the resource,
    including abstracts in the case of document-like objects or content
    descriptions in the case of visual resources.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;publisher&quot;&gt;

    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Publisher&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The entity responsible for making the resource
    available in its present form, such as a publishing house, a
    university department, or a corporate entity.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;contributor&quot;&gt;

    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Other Contributors&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;A person or organization not specified in a Creator
    element who has made significant intellectual contributions to the
    resource but whose contribution is secondary to any person or
    organization specified in a Creator element (for example, editor,
    transcriber, and illustrator).&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Date&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;A date associated with the creation or availability of
    the resource. Such a date is not to be confused with one belonging
    in the Coverage element, which would be associated with the resource
    only insofar as the intellectual content is somehow about that
    date. Recommended best practice is defined in a profile of ISO 8601
    [Date and Time Formats (based on ISO8601), W3C Technical Note,
    http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime] that includes (among others)
    dates of the forms YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD. In this scheme, for example,
    the date 1994-11-05 corresponds to November 5, 1994.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;type&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Type&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The category of the resource, such as home page,
    novel, poem, working paper, technical report, essay, dictionary. For
    the sake of interoperability, Type should be selected from an
    enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop
    series.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;format&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Format&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The data format of the resource, used to identify the
    software and possibly hardware that might be needed to display or
    operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability, Format
    should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under
    development in the workshop series.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;identifier&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Identifier&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;A string or number used to uniquely identify the
    resource. Examples for networked resources include URLs and URNs
    (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers, such as
    International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names are
    also candidates for this element.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;source&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Source&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;Information about a second resource from which the
    present resource is derived. While it is generally recommended that
    elements contain information about the present resource only, this
    element may contain a date, creator, format, identifier, or other
    metadata for the second resource when it is considered important for
    discovery of the present resource; recommended best practice is to
    use the Relation element instead.  For example, it is possible to
    use a Source date of 1603 in a description of a 1996 film adaptation
    of a Shakespearean play, but it is preferred instead to use Relation
    &quot;IsBasedOn&quot; with a reference to a separate resource whose
    description contains a Date of 1603. Source is not applicable if the
    present resource is in its original form.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;language&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Language&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The language of the intellectual content of the
    resource. Where practical, the content of this field should coincide
    with RFC 1766 [Tags for the Identification of Languages,
    http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt ]; examples include en, de,
    es, fi, fr, ja, th, and zh.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;relation&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Relation&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;An identifier of a second resource and its
    relationship to the present resource. This element permits links
    between related resources and resource descriptions to be
    indicated. Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf), a
    translation of a work (IsBasedOn), a chapter of a book (IsPartOf),
    and a mechanical transformation of a dataset into an image
    (IsFormatOf). For the sake of interoperability, relationships should
    be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under
    development in the workshop series.&lt;/rdfs:comment&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:isDefinedBy = &quot;&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;rdf:Description ID=&quot;coverage&quot;&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax#Property&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:label&gt;Coverage&lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
    &lt;rdfs:comment&gt;The spatial or temporal characteristics of the
    intellectual content of the resource. Spatial coverage refers to a
    physical region (e.g., celestial sector); use coordinates (e.g.,
    longitude and latitude) or place names that are from a controlled
    list or are fully spelled out. Temporal coverage refers to what the
