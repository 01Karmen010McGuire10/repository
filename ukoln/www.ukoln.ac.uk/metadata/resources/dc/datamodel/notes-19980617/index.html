    <h2>Dublin Core Datamodel Working Group Meeting </h2>
    
    <h3>OCLC, Dublin, Ohio, USA - 17-19 June 1998</h3>
    
    <h3>Notes </h3>
    
    <p><font size="-1">Andy Powell - 24/06/98 </font></p>
    <hr>
    
    <p>The first day started with introductions and identifying the purpose of
      the meeting. We agreed that we hoped to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>develop a clear understanding of the DC data model and its
        relationship to the RDF model </li>
      <li>understand the nature of qualification
        <ul>
          <li> clarification of methods of extension </li>
          <li> clarification of methods of refinement </li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>develop a structure to support current usage and further evolution of
        DC. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There was some discussion about the 5 RFCs - about what shoulod be in
      them, etc. The primary agreement here was that RFC#1 should come out asap.</p>
    
    <p>I would say that most discussion during the 3 days concentrated on the
      notion of 'what is qualification' and how it can be represented in RDF.
    </p>
    
    <p>We started with a discussion of the applicability of the RDF model for
      DC. Does it form a sensible basis for the DC model? It was agreed that it
      could be. The one point of contention was the notion of identifiers. In
      RDF everything being described <i>must</i> have a URI. In DC this has not
      been the case up until now - <i>identifier</i>, like all elements, is
      optional. So to a certain extent the use of RDF moves us away from the
      notion in DC that all elements are optional? Also, although everything can
      be assigned URIs (using UUIDs for example), operationally it may not be
      desirable for people to have to generate arbitrary URIs for objects before
      they can describe them using DC in RDF? </p>
    
    <p>The use of the term 'resource' in RDF is slightly confusing. In RDF all
      nodes are resources, some nodes represent real world objects (Web pages,
      etc.) some do not. We agreed that we needed some terminology for RDF
      resources, real world resources and resources that are both. During the
      meeting we used the term 'resource' in a normal library/Internet way. We
      used the term 'RDF resource' for nodes (i.e. where RDF uses the term
      resource). </p>
    
    <h3>Simple DC</h3>
    
    <p>We looked thru all/most of the 15 DC elements at a high level and agreed
      that they all followed the pattern below: </p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ] --- DC:Element ---&gt; [ R2 ]</tt></p>
    
    <p>or</p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ] --- DC:Element ---&gt; "string value"</tt></p>
    
    <p>where R is the URI of the resource being described and R2 is the URI of
      a second resource. It was noted that R2 may be one of two things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the URI of a resource containing the string value of the DC:Element
        property</li>
      <li>the URI of an RDF node (i.e. a structured value)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It was suggested that the latest version of the RDF spec makes it
      possible to differentiate between these two.</p>
    
    <p>So, for example, for DC.Rights we would have:</p>
    
    <p><tt>[ http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/ ] --- DC:Rights ---&gt; [
      http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/copyright.html ]</tt> </p>
    
    <p><tt></tt>or</p>
    
    <p><tt>[ http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/ ] --- DC:Rights ---&gt; "some
      rights statement"</tt></p>
    
    <p>There is an exception to this high level similarity between all the
      elements. Identifier has three valid forms:</p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ]</tt></p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ] --- DC:Identifier ---&gt; "string"</tt></p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ] --- DC:Identifier ---&gt; [ R2 ]</tt></p>
    
    <p>This is because the node labelled 'R' on its own provides the URI for
      the resource being described. The DC:Identifier property should only be
      used to provide additional identifiers for a resource.</p>
    
    <h3>Qualified DC</h3>
    
    <p>The notion that qualification can take two forms was discussed. Some
      qualifiers, role and type, refine the meaning of the element - in RDF
      terms they refine the <i>property</i>. Consider</p>
    
    <p><tt>[ R ] --- DC:Title ---&gt; "xxxx"</tt></p>
    
    <p>A <i>Title Type</i> of Alternative, for example, refines the meaning of
      the DC:Title property.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">Other qualifiers tell you something about the <i>value</i>
      of the <i>property</i>. Consider</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT"><tt>[ R ] --- DC.Date ---&gt; "1998-04-05"</tt></p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">A <i>Date Scheme</i> of ISO 8601 tells us something about
      the syntax/format of the date string value.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">There was some discussion about whether the mechanism that
      we define to handle these two kinds of qualifiers needed to differentiate
      between the two.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">In a strict RDF model, the first kind of qualification
      (refining the property), would be handled using reification. This is the
      process by which a property becomes a resource so that other statements
      can be made about it. Reification is typically used so that you can make
      assertions about who said that 'xxxx' is the DC:Title for [ R ]. Despite a
      long discussion about the use of reification for our purposes (refining a
      property) we concluded the day by saying that the RDF arc-node diagrams
      and associated XML syntax for reified graphs were too complex to consider
      as part of the DC data model.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">It was agreed that, in the DC data model, a <i>Role</i> is
      a <i>Type</i> but not vice versa, i.e. that any agreed mechanism for
      handling <i>Type</i>s in DC would be sufficient for <i>Role</i>s.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">Charles' paper introduces the notion of an <i>Annotation
      Node </i>as a way of handling Roles and Types. Here's an example of an
      Annotation Node:</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT"><tt><img src="index_files/annotation.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="98" width="487"></tt>
    </p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">Note that the XX namespace was undecided at this stage but
      differentiating it from the DC namespace was seen as a potenial
      requirement.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">Note that the value of RDF:Value and the value of
      XX:Title.Type are shown as strings here but either or both could be nodes.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">An alternative proposition was put forward for handling
      Roles and Types using InstanceOf arcs. Here's the same example:</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT"><img src="index_files/instanceof.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="139" width="487"></p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">Note that in this case the value of RDF:InstanceOf must be
      a node (and so must have a URI).</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">A comparison of the two approaches.</p>
    
    <p align="LEFT">InstanceOf</p>
    <ul>
      <li>requires the use of nodes/URIs - may be bad for long lists of types,
        may be OK for short lists?</li>
      <li>may be used to <i>'typecheck' </i>other arcs coming out of the node.
        This is good for DC/RDF tools.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Annotation Node:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>can use string or node</li>
      <li>no possibility of typechecking other arcs originating from the node</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note that the value of <i>Role</i> is typically taken from a long
      enumerated list. The value of <i>Type</i> is typically taken from a short
      enumerated list.</p>
    
    <p>Annotation nodes were agreed as the best way of handling Roles and
      Types. Some work over night developed a similar way of handling Schemes.</p>
    
    <p>Should the value of an Annotation Node be a string or a node?</p>
    
    <p>Strings are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>easy to work with</li>
      <li>may have to be hardwired into code</li>
      <li>require external registries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Nodes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>are unambiguous</li>
      <li>the URI can be used to point to the definition (i.e. registries come
        as part of the solution in some sense).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>No decision was reached on this issue.</p>
    
    <h3>Qualified DC Template</h3>
    
    <p>By the final day, and after much drawing of arc-node diagrams we had
      developed a simple template for the way in which Roles, Types and Schemes
      are represented within the RDF model.</p>
    
    <p><img src="index_files/template.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="156" width="585"></p>
    
    <p>Note that the namespace for qualifiers is DCQ - i.e. it is separate from
      the normal DC namespace.</p>
    
    <p>Note that all <i>values </i>for DCQ properties could either be strings
      or nodes (to be decided). In the examples below values are shown as
      strings to save showing them as either strings or nodes in each case.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    
    <p>We then proceeded to apply this to all or most of the 15 DC elements.
      Diagrams follow:</p>
    
    <p><b>DC.Title</b></p>
    
    <p><img src="index_files/title.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="98" width="487"></p>
    
    <p><b>DC.Relation</b></p>
    
    <p><img src="index_files/relation.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="98" width="431"></p>
    
    <p><b>DC.Subject</b></p>
    
    <p>See examples at &lt;URL:<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/resources/rdf/examples/5/">http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/resources/rdf/examples/5/</a>&gt;</p>
    
    <p><b>DC.Creator</b></p>
    
    <p><img src="index_files/creator1.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="98" width="487"></p>
    
    <p>...repetition of roles...</p>
    
    <p><img src="index_files/creator2.gif" alt="{short description of image}" height="106" width="487"></p>
    
    <p>...personal vs. corporate...</p>
    
    <p>There was some discussion about the personal vs. corporate debate. Some
      people felt that person/organisation was really a scheme thing. In the end
      we decided to push the problem into another namespace (i.e. make it
      someone elses problem). For example we might ask the vCard people to
      introduce a specific attribute into the vCard proposal that differentiates
      people from organisation - current vCard doesn't have this distinction.</p>
    
    <h3>XML Syntax</h3>
    
    <p>Most of the meeting concerned arc-node diagrams. XML serialisation
      syntax was considered at various times. An example was given of how the
      abbreviated syntax can be used. The abbreviated syntax has some advantages
      in that it looks more like what people would be likely to come up with if
      they simply invented their own DTD for describing Web resources. It's
      disadvantage is that it is difficult to go straight from an arc-node
      diagram to the abbreviated syntax (and get it right). Better to go to the
      full syntax first, then abbreviate it.</p>
