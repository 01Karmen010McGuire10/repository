    <h3>The Job I do</h3>

    <p>I joined UKOLN as a Research Officer in January 2001.</p>

    <p>For part of my time, I support the work of the <a title="Interoperability Focus" href="/interop-focus/">Interoperability Focus</a>. This work is concerned particularly with contributing to information strategies which facilitate the effective exchange and reuse of information. Such "interoperability" is a key component of a range of initiatives within the government, education and cultural heritage sectors which all place renewed emphasis on openness, accessibility and the sharing of information resources.</p>

    <p>Since January 2004, I have also worked on the <a title="JISC Information Environment Metadata Schema Registry Project" href="/projects/iemsr/">IEMSR</a> project to develop a pilot Metadata Schema Registry as a shared service for the <a title="JISC Information Environment" href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=ie_home">JISC Information Environment</a>.</p>

    <p>I also contribute to the JISC <a title="JISC Information Environment Service Registry Project" href="http://www.mimas.ac.uk/iesr/">IESR</a> project, led by <a title="MIMAS" href="http://www.mimas.ac.uk/">MIMAS, University of Manchester</a>, which is building a pilot Service Registry for the Information Environment. My role is primarily an advisory one, particularly in the areas of metadata schemas for collection and service description.</p>

    <p>I support the work of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a> in developing metadata standards for resource discovery. I am presently chair of the <a title="DCMI Collection Description Working Group" href="http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/">Dublin Core Collection Description Working Group</a>. I am a member of the <a title="DCMI Advisory Board membership" href="http://dublincore.org/about/organization/committeemembers.shtml#advisory">DCMI Advisory Board</a> and a contributor to the Dublin Core <a title="DCMI Architecture Working Group" href="http://dublincore.org/groups/architecture/">Architecture</a> and <a title="DCMI Registry Working Group" href="http://dublincore.org/groups/registry/">Registry</a> Working Groups.</p>

	<p>I am a member of the <a title="NISO Metasearch Initiative Task Group 2: Collection Description" href="http://www.niso.org/committees/MS-task_groups.html#2">NISO Metasearch Initiative Task Group 2: Collection Description</a>.</p>

    <p>In the course of my work I liaise with, and support the work of, other UKOLN staff working in related areas, such as those of metadata and resource discovery, and have supported the work of the <a title="Metadata for Education Group" href="/metadata/education/">Metadata for Education Group</a>. </p>

    <p>Lists of my <a title="Pete Johnston&quot;s publications list" href="pubs/">publications</a> and <a title="Pete Johnston&quot;s presentations list" href="pres/">presentations</a> are available.</p>

    <p>More information and some links to assorted works-in-progress can be found on my <a title="Pete Johnston's Personal Home Page" href="http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lispj/">personal home page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Past Projects at UKOLN</h3>

	<p>During early 2005, I contributed to work on the development of the <a title="People&apos;s Network" href="http://www.peoplesnetwork.gov.uk/">People&apos;s Network</a> Discovery Service, particularly on the metadata schema to be used for item-level metadata harvesting.</p>

    <p>From December 2002 until June 2003, I worked on the <a title="CORES Project" href="/metadata/cores/">CORES</a> project, which aimed to encourage and facilitate the sharing of metadata semantics in machine-readable forms. My work for CORES focused primarily on the <a title="CORES Metadata Schema Registry" href="http://cores.dsd.sztaki.hu/">CORES metadata schemas registry</a>.</p>

    <p>From April 2002 until January 2003, I worked on the <a href="/metadata/education/regproj/">MEG Registry development project</a>.</p>

    <p>From June 2001 until December 2002, I shared the work of the <a title="Collection Description Focus" href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/cd-focus/">Collection Description Focus</a> with <a title="Bridget Robinson's Staff Page" href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/ukoln/staff/b.r.robinson/">Bridget Robinson</a>.
