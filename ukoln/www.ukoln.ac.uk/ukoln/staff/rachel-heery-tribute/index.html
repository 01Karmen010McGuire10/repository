    <h1>Rachel Heery: A Tribute from Her UKOLN Colleagues</h1>
	  <div class="module">
       <!-- content starts -->

	     <p>Rachel joined UKOLN as a Research Officer in August 1995 from SLS (Information
	       Systems) Ltd, where she was Product Manager for the SLS Database Service.
	       The mid-1990s was a time of rapid expansion for UKOLN, with the emergence
	       of project-based funding opportunities through the JISC's Electronic Libraries
	       Programme (eLib) and the European Union's research framework programmes. Rachel
	       joined UKOLN to work on an eLib-funded project known as ROADS (Resource Organisation
	       And Discovery in Subject-based services), the first of many UKOLN research
	       projects that related to metadata, resource discovery and semantic interoperability.
	       ROADS was very quickly augmented by two European Union-funded projects that
	       covered broadly the same topics, so throughout the late 1990s, UKOLN began
	       to expand and restructure to accommodate a growing research and development
	       team. In turn, Rachel became the highly respected leader of this team.</p>
	     <p> ROADS itself was concerned with the development of services known at the
	       time as subject gateways. These used the traditional skills of information
	       professionals - quality criteria for the selection of content and standardised
	       resource description - in an attempt to impose some order on the then emerging
	       Internet. UKOLN's interest in this topic largely focused on the resource description
	       standards (or metadata) used by these services and their potential for supporting
	       semantic interoperability. In 1996, Rachel produced an early review of metadata
	       formats for the journal <em>Program</em>, and later co-wrote with Lorcan Dempsey
	       (then UKOLN's Director) an influential article on emerging metadata practice
	       that was published in the <em>Journal of Documentation</em> in 1998. This
	       was also the time when Rachel and other UKOLN colleagues began to get heavily
	       involved with the emerging Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI). Rachel's
	       interest in metadata was primarily practical, focused on an honest appraisal
	       of how it could (and would) be used in real world situations. </p>
	     <p>Naturally, these early projects led to the development of new research perspectives
	       and priorities for both UKOLN and Rachel. A European counterpart to ROADS,
	       the DESIRE (Development of a European Service for Information on Research
	       and Education) project, proved to be a catalysing agent for two of Rachel's
	       most significant ongoing interoperability-related research interests.</p>
	     <p>The first of these explored in more detail the potentially complex relationships
	       between metadata schemas as they are promoted by standards bodies and the
	       various ways in which they are used (or optimised) by local applications.
	       Influenced by the W3C's Resource Description Framework (RDF) and emerging
	       discussions within the DCMI, UKOLN contributed to the community development
	       of 'application profiles' as a conceptual means of managing the interaction
	       between metadata schemas and the service applications based on them. Rachel,
	       together with her UKOLN colleague Manjula Patel, went on to publish an influential
	       <em>Ariadne</em> article in 2000 that both defined application profiles and
	       explored their practical use in a number of different contexts. Work on application
	       profiles has continued, in particular as part of DCMI activities. Partly through
	       a CEN (European Committee for Standardization) Workshop Agreement approved
	       in 2003 (CEN 14855:2003), Rachel contributed to the development of the <em>Dublin
	       Core Application Profile Guidelines</em> that were published in 2005. Stuart
	       Weibel of OCLC has described Rachel&#8217;s work on application profiles as
	       &#8220;perhaps her most important single contribution to the Dublin Core community.&#8221;</p>
	     <p>A second, but related, area of work that Rachel was deeply involved in focused
	       on the development of registry services that are able to provide authoritative
	       information about metadata schemas and their use. Building on an experimental
	       DESIRE registry, Rachel made a major contribution to a string of collaborative
	       research projects that explored the development of metadata registry services
	       in more detail. For example, the European Commission-funded SCHEMAS Forum
	       for Metadata Implementers and CORES Forum on Shared Metadata Vocabularies
	       experimented with using Semantic Web tools like RDF as a means of building
	       metadata registries. Rachel reported on this work in a series of papers given
	       at the annual Dublin Core conferences. This interest in registries later migrated
	       into the JISC domain through Rachel's involvement in the JISC Information
	       Environment Metadata Schema Registry (IEMSR) initiative.</p>
	     <p>Towards the end of her time at UKOLN, Rachel began to get involved in the
	       growing number of activities related to institutional repository development
	       and deployment. She worked on the JISC-funded eBank UK project that investigated
	       the use of open access infrastructures to disseminate crystallographic data.
	       She was also a member of the programme advisory board for JISC's FAIR (Focus
	       on Access to Institutional Resources) Programme (2002-05) and later of the
	       JISC Repositories and Preservation Advisory Group (RPAG). In support of the
	       JISC's Digital Repositories Programme (2005-07), Rachel, together with Sheila
	       Anderson of the Arts and Humanities Data Service, published a review of digital
	       repository activities in 2005. This was followed in 2006 by a <em>Digital
	       Repositories Roadmap</em> report for JISC, jointly written with Andy Powell
	       of the Eduserv Foundation (also a former UKOLN colleague). Since leaving UKOLN,
	       Rachel produced an updated review of this roadmap for the JISC and presented
	       it as recently as the JISC Repositories and Preservation Programme meeting
	       held in Birmingham on 6-7 May, this year.</p>
	     <p>Through research collaboration and through her involvement in international
	       committees and working groups, Rachel built up a large international network
	       of friends and colleagues. Rachel's early involvement in the DCMI has already
	       been noted, and she was a member of the Advisory Board and co-chair of the
	       Dublin Core Registry Working Group for many years. She was also a member of
	       the programme committees of various scholarly conferences, most notably being
	       Programme Chair of the 8th European Conference on Digital Libraries (ECDL),
	       which was held at the University of Bath in September 2004.</p>
        <p>Within UKOLN, Rachel became the leader of UKOLN's research and development 
          team (and ultimately Deputy Director of UKOLN), and for over a decade 
          was highly successful in not only obtaining additional research income 
          but in matching staff effort to an ever-changing portfolio of research 
          projects. Rachel was also acting Director of UKOLN between June and 
          October 2000, after Lorcan Dempsey left to take a new post with JISC. 
          The strength and breadth of all of UKOLN's work today is a lasting testament 
          to Rachel's success in leading the research and development team for 
          over a decade. After suffering repeated bouts of illness, Rachel finally 
          took early retirement from UKOLN in October 2007.</p>
	     <p>Rachel was well-known both within UKOLN and elsewhere for both her honesty
	       and her forthright manner, particularly in meetings. While this frankness
	       could be rather disconcerting for those who had not encountered Rachel before,
	       closer acquaintance demonstrated that this was not based on ego, but was just
	       evidence of a quick mind and a determination to ask the right questions. In
	       wide-ranging discussions on metadata architectures or semantic interoperability,
	       Rachel had the uncanny knack of steering a conversation back to fundamental
	       principles, largely based on a realistic assessment of how standards and tools
	       would actually be used in real-world scenarios. This led to some very entertaining
	       (and fruitful) discussions both at UKOLN and elsewhere. In person, Rachel
	       could be extremely funny and had a keen sense of the absurd. For example,
	       she found it amusing how particular discussion topics would come around time
	       and again; some recent discussions on repositories reminded her of debates
	       within UKOLN&#8217;s European research projects a decade ago! Rachel approached
	       her illness without sentimentality and with the same honesty and candour that
	       she employed elsewhere in her life. Once, when facing a course of gruelling
	       treatment, she commented how difficult it was to contemplate being ill in
	       the near future when you were actually feeling fine. In one of her final e-mails,
	       she mentioned that she had been through a rough patch, but was looking forward
	       to going on holiday.</p>
	     <p>Notwithstanding her many achievements in the wider world, we at UKOLN valued
	       Rachel most as a trusted colleague and friend. Above all, we will miss her
	       honesty and good humour. On behalf of UKOLN, we would like to express our
	       sincerest sympathy to her husband Mike, her children, and the rest of her
	       family and friends. She will be missed.</p>
