<div class="rss-description">
<p>2001-08-28, After the MIReG conference in Brussels, Belgium (see <a href="http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/ida">http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/ida</a>) it was decided to set up an Advisory Board and develop a &quot;EU Government Metadata Framework&quot;. Since the conference the Advisory Board, especially the UK Office of the e-Envoy, has worked on producing a draft of extensions or additions to Dublin Core Elements.</p>
<p>This start draft of additions is based on the draft UK e-Government Metadata Standard, which in turn includes input from Australian AGLS and work from the UK Records Office.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board for the &quot;EU Government Metadata Framework&quot; is very interested in your views on these draft extensions to Dublin Core. Are they the right elements? Are other elements needed for dealing with resource discovery and government information?</p>
<p>You have approximately 1 week from 2001-08-28 to comment on this first draft. Please direct your comments to the DC Government WG list.</p>
<p>After gathering comments, the Advisory Board will prepare the final proposal and submit it to the DCMI Usage Board.</p>
