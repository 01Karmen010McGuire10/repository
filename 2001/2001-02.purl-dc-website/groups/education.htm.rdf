   <dc:title>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative - Education Working Group</dc:title>

   <dc:description>The objectives of this Working Group are to discuss and develop a proposal
for the use of Dublin Core metadata in the description of educational
resources. The scope includes educational resources applicable for many
national education communities and cross-sectoral communities (eg, K-12,
further and Hhigher education, and lifelong learning).The WG will develop qualifiers and/or extensions to the Dublin Core element
set that will describe educational material for the purpose of enhancing
resource discovery. It is expected that the resulting metadata will include
educational qualifiers that fall within the scope of existing Dublin Core
elements and potentially some that are specific to the domain of education.</dc:description>
