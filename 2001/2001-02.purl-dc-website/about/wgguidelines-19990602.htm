<H3><FONT COLOR="#990000">2 June 1999 </FONT></H3>
<P>&nbsp;</P><HR noshade>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Purpose and background</FONT></H3>
<P>This document defines the procedures which are employed in developing 
                Dublin Core specifications and in carrying out other tasks to 
                advance the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. These tasks are carried 
                out by Dublin Core Working Groups. In particular, this document 
                sets out guidelines for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the initiation of new work items;</LI>
<LI>the establishment and conduct of Working Groups;</LI>
<LI>the responsibilities of the chairs and members of Working 
                  Groups;</LI>
<LI>the communication of Working Group documents and reports; 
                  and</LI>
<LI>the ratification of decisions on work items.</LI>
</UL>
<P>An initial draft of this document was developed in November 1998 
                by the Dublin Core Process Working Group. The Group was formed 
                at a joint meeting of the Dublin Core Policy Advisory Committee 
                and Technical Advisory Committee, held in Washington DC on 1 November 
                1998. Between April and June 1999, the document was discussed 
                and amended by the “DC Coordination Committee” Working Group.</P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Initiation of a new Dublin Core work item</FONT></H3>
<P>A proposal for a new Dublin Core work item may originate from:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Dublin Core Directorate; or</LI>
<LI>the Dublin Core International Workshop; or</LI>
<LI>anyone who participates in the Dublin Core (dc-general) international 
                  discussion list.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the first case, a work item proposal will be developed and 
                documented by the Directorate. In the last two cases, a work item 
                proposal will be developed, documented and submitted by a proposer 
                to the Directorate. In all three cases, the Directorate will consult 
                with the Advisory Committee. The proposer must be willing to participate 
                in any Working Group dealing with the work item.</P>
<P>The Directorate may either:</P>
<UL>
<LI>approve the work item and refer it to an existing Working 
                  Group for action;</LI>
<LI>approve the work item and establish a new Working Group to 
                  carry it out;</LI>
<LI>decide to take no further action; or</LI>
<LI>defer any action until a specified date.</LI>
</UL>
<P>This decision should be documented and communicated to the proposer. 
                In the case of the third and fourth courses of action, reasons 
                should be given. The Directorate will not make a decision which 
                is contrary to the clear advice of the Advisory Committee.</P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Working Groups</FONT></H3>
<P>Dublin Core Working Groups are constituted to address work items 
                raised in the course of Dublin Core activities. Membership of 
                Dublin Core Working Groups is open to all interested parties. 
                A Working Group becomes dormant at the completion of its charter 
                and should not address additional work items without charter revisions 
                approved by the Dublin Core Directorate.</P>
<P>Chairs and Co-Chairs (if any) of Working Groups are appointed 
                by the Dublin Core Directorate. The Chair of the Advisory Committee 
                has the task of following up and coordinating Working Group chairs.</P>
<P>Because the Dublin Core Workshops provide an opportunity to review 
                work items and to introduce new people, all working groups will 
                automatically expire at each Dublin Core Workshop, although they 
                may be re-constituted if necessary.</P>
<P>Working Group activities are conducted through a combination 
                of face-to-face meetings, teleconferencing, and an archived mailing 
                list. Minutes from face-to-face meetings and teleconference calls 
                will be maintained by the chair or the chair’s designee.</P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Responsibilities of Working Group chairs</FONT></H3>
<P>Working Group chairs will:</P>
<UL>
<LI>write the Working Group charter, in consultation with the 
                  Dublin Core Directorate;</LI>
<LI>invite all interested parties, through the Dublin Core (dc-general) 
                  list, to join the Working Group;</LI>
<LI>ensure that an e-mail list is established for use by all Working 
                  Group members, using the Mailbase service (<A HREF="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/">http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/</A>);</LI>
<LI>ensure that an official list of Working Group members is maintained;</LI>
<LI>submit to the Directorate and the Chair of the Advisory Committee 
                  a list of deliverables and their target dates;</LI>
<LI>manage the work of the Working Group to ensure that deliverables 
                  are completed by the target dates;</LI>
<LI>should a deliverable miss the target date, report the reason 
                  for slippage to the Directorate and the Chair of the Advisory 
                  Committee, and submit a new target date;</LI>
<LI>make regular reports of progress to the dc-general list (these 
                  may be quite informal);</LI>
<LI>ensure that all Working Group members have an opportunity 
                  to approve or disapprove all decisions and Draft Proposals of 
                  the Group;</LI>
<LI>resolve any lack of consensus in the Group; and</LI>
<LI>ensure that decisions are accompanied by explanation that 
                  will support that consensus both within the Working Group and 
                  in the larger community.</LI>
</UL>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Responsibilities of Working Group members</FONT></H3>
<P>Working Group members will:</P>
<UL>
<LI>participate in e-mail discussions in a timely fashion;</LI>
<LI>read and comment on draft proposals and related documents;</LI>
<LI>carry out any actions which are assigned to them by the Working 
                  Group chair, with their agreement;</LI>
<LI>participate in face-to-face meetings and teleconference calls 
                  when possible; and</LI>
<LI>be sensitive to the importance of consensus as a central feature 
                  of the Dublin Core process.</LI>
</UL>
<P>It is recognised that some individuals will join Working Groups 
                in order to follow, rather than participate in, the discussions. 
                This is acceptable, although Working Group members are encouraged 
                to share their expertise with the community through active participation.</P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Conduct of Working Groups</FONT></H3>
<P>Within each working group, the discussion will be focussed on 
                discrete “open issues”. Discussion of open issues will be managed 
                by the chair via email, teleconference, and/or face-to-face meetings. 
                Such discussions will lead to decisions or actions.</P>
<P>“Actions” are tasks deemed necessary to the conversion of open 
                issues to decisions. Actions must be assigned to specific individuals 
                or groups of individuals, and should include a deadline as well. 
                Examples of actions include preparing a document or document component, 
                articulating a technical solution to a problem, and eliciting 
                information from an individual or group external to the working 
                group.</P>
<P>“Decisions” are made in teleconference or face-to-face meetings 
                by a simple majority of those present. Decisions made via e-mail 
                discussions will reflect rough consensus as judged by the chair. 
                Failure to respond in e-mail discussions of open issues or proposed 
                decisions on the working group mailing list may be construed by 
                the chair as evidence of agreement. Reversals of decisions made 
                previously by the Working Group require a 2/3 majority (in the 
                case of teleconference or face-to-face meetings) or a very clear 
                consensus as judged by the chair (in the case of e-mail discussions).</P>
<P>In the conduct of e-mail discussions, the Chair will ensure that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the discussion is focussed on open issues, leading to specific 
                  actions or decisions;</LI>
<LI>time limits are imposed for discussion and voting (intervals 
                  will vary according to the complexity of issues, and established 
                  and extended at the discretion of the chair); and</LI>
<LI>the subject lines of e-mail messages are constructed so as 
                  to facilitate the reference to particular open issues.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In the conduct of teleconference or face-to-face discussions, 
                the Chair will ensure that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the discussion is focussed on open issues, leading to specific 
                  actions or decisions;</LI>
<LI>meetings are scheduled in advance (1 week or more for teleconferences, 
                  4 weeks or more for face-to-face meetings);</LI>
<LI>meetings have advance agendas; and</LI>
<LI>meetings are conducted according to formal techniques for 
                  managing meetings (such as agendas, time limits, queues, and 
                  rules of order).</LI>
</UL>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Working Group documents</FONT></H3>
<P>All working group documents are publicly accessible via the <A HREF="../index.htm">Dublin 
Core Web site</A>. The Web site will include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the charter for the working group;</LI>
<LI>a list of expected deliverables, and deadlines for completion;</LI>
<LI>a schedule of events (meetings and conference calls, past 
                  and planned);</LI>
<LI>the current version of the Group’s Working Draft (if any); 
                  and</LI>
<LI>a link to the archive of the e-mail sent to the Working Group 
                  list.</LI>
</UL>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Working Group reports </FONT></H3>
<P>The three key status identifiers for Working Group reports are 
                ‘Working Draft’, ‘Draft Proposal’ and ‘Dublin Core Specification’.</P>
<P>During its development within the Working Group, a report may 
                go through a number of Working Draft versions. The Working Draft 
                may be developed by the Chair, or by one or more members of the 
                Working Group with the oversight of the Chair. These versions 
                may be notified to members of the Working Group only, or may be 
                given wider notification at the discretion of the Chair.</P>
<P>Once the Chair is satisfied that a report meets the requirements 
                of the Working Group charter and reflects the consensus of the 
                Group, he or she will issue it as a Draft Proposal from the Working 
                Group. The Chair will submit the Draft Proposal to the dc-general 
                list for initial comment, accompanied by a submission note identifying 
                probable areas of public controversy that might bear on broad 
                acceptance. The Draft Proposal should also contain a proposed 
                deadline for these comments. A short response time (no more than 
                two weeks) is recommended. Substantive public comments should 
                be either accommodated in a revised Draft Proposal, or their rejection 
                should be justified in a document accessible via the Working Group 
                Web pages.</P>
<P>Following consideration of these comments, the Chair may refer 
                the Draft Proposal back to the Working Group for further consideration 
                and development of a revised Draft Proposal. This process may 
                iterate.</P>
<P>Once the Chair is satisfied that there is broad community consensus, 
                he or she will submit the Draft Proposal to the Advisory Committee 
                for review. The Advisory Committee may either refer the Draft 
                Proposal back to the Working Group Chair with comments, or forward 
                the Draft Proposal to the Directorate for final approval.</P>
<P>The work item may be abandoned following comment at the Draft 
                Proposal stage, if these comments reveal major flaws or seriously 
                unsatisfactory features. In this event, reasons for the decision 
                should be issued by the Working Group Chair.</P>
<P>The highest status which can be assigned to a Working Group report 
                is a ‘Dublin Core Specification’. The decision on whether to assign 
                this status will be made by the Directorate, after considering 
                the advice of the Advisory Committee. The date of this decision 
                must be recorded, and the decision must be announced to the Dublin 
                Core (dc-general) discussion list. A Dublin Core specification 
                is assigned a date of issue and a version number, and is made 
                available from the Dublin Core Web site.</P>
<P>The Working Group will continue to exist until the Dublin Core 
                Workshop following this decision. The Working Group chair, or 
                the chair’s delegate, must present a report at that workshop.</P>
<H3><FONT COLOR="#003366">Dublin Core Notes</FONT></H3>
<P>A Note is a document which is made available by the Dublin Core 
                Metadata Initiative for discussion only. The publication of a 
                Note implies no endorsement of any kind.</P>
              <P>A draft Note is submitted to the Directorate from any member 
                of the Dublin Core community. The Directorate will acknowledge 
                receipt of the Note and will forward it, if appropriate, to the 
                Advisory Committee or to the relevant Working Group. The Advisory 
                Committee or Working Group will discuss the document and will 
                recommend whether it should be endorsed and published as a Note, 
                and whether it should become an action item for a Working Group.</P>
