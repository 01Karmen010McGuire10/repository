                PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY. BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE 
                CODE BASE AND DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THIS LICENSE (THE &quot;License&quot;), 
                YOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE. 
              </h3>
              <h3>Section One: Your Rights</h3>
              <p> Subject to these terms and conditions of this License, Dublin 
                Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) (the &quot;Original Contributor&quot;) 
                and each subsequent contributor (collectively with the Original 
                Contributor, the &quot;Contributors&quot;) hereby grants you a 
                non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, transferable, copyright license 
                to execute, prepare derivative works of, and distribute (internally 
                and externally), for commercial and noncommercial purposes, the 
                original code contributed by Original Contributor and all Modifications 
                (collectively called the &quot;Program&quot;).</p>
              <p>This non-exclusive license (with respect to the grant from a 
                particular Contributor) automatically terminates for any entity 
                that initiates legal action for intellectual property infringement 
                against such Contributor as of the initiation of such action.</p>
              <h3>Section Two: Your License Grant</h3>
              <p> If you make a Modification and distribute it externally you 
                are a Contributor, and you must provide such Modification in source 
                code form to the Original Contributor within thirty (30) days 
                of such distribution under the terms of the license in Section 
                1 above in accordance with the instructions below. A &quot;Modification&quot; 
                to the Program is any addition to or deletion from the contents 
                of any file of the Program or of any Modifications and any new 
                file that contains any part of the Program or of any Modifications.</p>
              <p>As a Contributor you represent that your contributions are your 
                original creation(s) and, to the best of your knowledge, no third 
                party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual 
                property claims) relating to your Modification. You represent 
                that your contribution submission includes complete details of 
                any license or other restriction associated with any part of your 
                Modification (including a copy of any applicable license agreement).</p>
              <p>If, after submitting your contribution, you learn of a third 
                party claim or other restriction relating to your contribution, 
                you shall promptly modify your contribution submission and take 
                all reasonable steps to inform those who may have received the 
                Program containing such Modification.</p>
              <h3>Section Three: Redistribution</h3>
              <p> If you distribute the Program or any derivative work of the 
                Program in a form to which the recipient can make Modifications, 
                you must ensure that the recipient of the Program or derivative 
                work of the Program accepts the terms of this License with respect 
                to the Program and any Modifications included your distribution. 
                In addition, in each source and data file of the Program and any 
                Modification you distribute must contain the following:</p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;The contents

              <p>If you redistribute the Program or any derivative work of the 
                Program in a form to which the recipient can not make Modifications, 
                you must include the following in appropriate and conspicuous 
                locations:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Includes software, 
                  which is Copyright (c) 2000- (insert then current year) Dublin 
                  Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and others. All rights reserved.&quot;</font></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Any redistribution must be made without any further restriction 
                on the recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.</p>
              <h3>Section Four: Termination</h3>
              <p> If you fail to comply with this License, your rights (but not 
                your obligations) under this License shall terminate automatically 
                unless you cure such breach within thirty days of becoming aware 
                of the noncompliance. All sublicenses granted by you which preexist 
                such termination and are properly granted shall survive such termination.</p>
              <h3>Section Five: Other Terms</h3>
              <p> Except for the copyright notices required above or as otherwise 
                agreed in writing, you may not use any trademark of any of the 
                Contributors.</p>
              <p>All transfers of the Program or any part theeof shall be made 
                in compliance with U.S. Trade regulations or other restrictions 
                of the U.S. Department of Commerce, as well as other similar trade 
                or commerce restrictions which might apply.</p>
              <p>Any patent obtained by any party covering the Program or any 
                part thereof must include a provision providing for the free, 
                perpetual and unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use by 
                any third party.</p>
              <p>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
                conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement 
                or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
                they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If 
                you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
                under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as 
                a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, 
                if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
                of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
                through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
                License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
                Program.</p>
              <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
                under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section 
                is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to 
                apply in other circumstances.</p>
              <p>YOU AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS-IS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
                OF ANY KIND (EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
                ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
                PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTY OF NON INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
                THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
                SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
                LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS 
                OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED 
                AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, 
                OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY 
                OUT OF THE USE OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
                OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
              <p>The Original Contributor from time to time may change this License, 
                and the amended license will apply to all copies of the Program 
                downloaded after the new license is posted. This License provides 
                you no implied rights or licenses to the intellectual property 
                of any Contributor.</p>
