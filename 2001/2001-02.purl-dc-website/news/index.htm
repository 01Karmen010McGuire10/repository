<p>This document is a Proposal from the Dublin Core Education Working Group [DCEd] 
to the Dublin Core Usage Committee of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative [DCMI]. 
The content of this document is intended to reflect the consensus reached within 
DCEd. DCEd proposes the adoption of the following: (1) two new domain-specific 
elements with accompanying element qualifiers for a dc-ed namespace; and (2) a 
new domain-specific qualifier to dc:relation for the dc-ed namespace. In addition, 
DCEd proposes the endorsement of three elements from the Instructional Management 
Systems (IMS) namespace (pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding with IEEE 
LTSC). </p>

                is a small, flexible help utility for metadata applications and 
                is intended to complement the help pages embedded within existing 
                software. Start DC-assist up once at the beginning of your session 
                for quick and easy access to a set of help pages that provide:</p>
              <ul>
                <li> element and qualifier definitions, </li>
                <li> comments, </li>

              <p>DC-assist can be configured for local use using a configuration 
                file. In the future, it will be enhanced so that as much information 
                as possible will be extracted from an 'application profile' stored 
                in a metadata<br>
                registry (such as the one being developed by the <a href="http://www.schemas-forum.org/">SCHEMAS 
                project</a>), directly from RDF schema definition files, or from 
                some combination of both.</p>
              <p>The default DC-assist configuration is based on the elements 
                defined in the 'Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, Version 1.1: 
                Reference Description' and the qualifiers defined in the 'Dublin 
                Core Qualifiers'. This configuration also contains around 100

                Education Channel</b></p>
              <p><b>Home Page: </b><b><a href="http://www.education.vic.gov.au/">http://www.education.vic.gov.au/</a> 
                </b>(Site is still under development)</p>
              <p>The Victorian Education Channel (an educational gateway for the 
                State of Victoria, Australia) has been developed to integrate 
                access to educational information and services available on the 
                web. In particular, it provides integrated access to resources 
                from the Department of Education, Employment and Training (DEET), 
                Victoria and associated providers. It also supports discovery 
                of other resources pertinent to Victorian education. The Channel 
                is for teachers, students, parents and the community - anyone 
                requiring information with an educational focus - and covers all 
                sectors of education from early school to tertiary and vocational.</p>
              <p> The Victorian Education Channel uses the standard 15 Dublin 
                Core (DC) elements and 'audience' as an extra element (as recommended 
                by the DC-Education Working Group). All elements have qualifiers, 
                are expressed in RDF, and many have controlled vocabularies or 
                recommended formats. Elements can be repeated and are not mandatory 
                although for national interoperability, a minimal set is required. 
                The DC classification is backed up by a full text indexing capability. 
                DC records are created using a 'workbench' that combines original 
                authoring or metadata with harvesting of pre-existing metadata, 
                in HTML or RDF. The workbench also 'putates' values that the author 
                can choose to ratify. The records are searched by default or user-structured 
                searches or browsed.<br>
                Searches are complemented by access to the full-text indexes. 
                Dewey DC has been included as a global taxonomy to complement 
                the more locally-relevant taxonomies but it is not expected that 
                all resources will be classified using this facility.</p>
              <p> DEET has been actively classifying resources for several years 
                so the channel is being populated by a combination of imported, 
                existing records and newly created records. The channel will be 
                supported by resource authoring, and other systems, that either 
                contribute to the generation of<br>
                classification records or use the information in the records as 
                data for user-specific applications.</p>

              <p>The key differences between &lt;meta&gt; elements in XHTML and

              <blockquote>

                  than &lt;META&gt;, <br>
                  - empty elements (for example, &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;link&gt;) 
                  must end with '/&gt;'.</p>

                at improving public access to environmental and natural resources 
                data and information. The focus of the Project is on developing 
                intuitive and easy to use search tools and strategies. Staff and 
                agency participants catalog many kinds of electronic information 
                resources using qualified Dublin Core elements. These resources 
                can be used to develop advanced search and retrieval techniques 
                that integrate access to this information across agency Web sites. 
                The search interface is called Bridges (<a href="http://bridges.state.mn.us/">http://bridges.state.mn.us/</a>), 
                signifying the metaphorical spanning of information across Minnesota 
                state agencies. Based on project research findings and using principles 
                of information architecture, a &quot;blueprint&quot; specifying 
                best practices for Minnesota state environmental Web sites is

                (CWA). It will be published with a foreword and with some formal 
                changes of the references in DC 1.1.</p>
              <p>The workshop now continues the work with Guidance Information 
                for the use of Dublin Core in Europe. The Guidance material is 
                intended to bring together documentation on the use of Dublin 
                Core in Europe in the following areas: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Strategic documentation (i.e.: outlining the reasons for choosing 
                  Dublin Core or another Metadata Element Set).</li>

                <li>Technical implementation guidelines</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In parallel with this activity, is a task for the workshop to 
                maintain and promote a knowledge base for metadata for multimedia 
                information (the &quot;Observatory&quot;) to continually assess 
                relationships between Dublin Core and other initiatives - in order 
                to assist evolution of standardised metadata schemes. This knowledge 
                base identifies the key activities currently being undertaken 
                in Europe and across the world - the scope of these activities 
                and related work in European projects and programs.</p>

                to Best Practice: Dublin Core</A> addresses Dublin Core 1.0 as 
                documented in RFC 2413 and is an immportant result of CIMI's Dublin 
                Core Testbed, an on-going effort to explore the usability, simplicity, 
                and technical feasibility of Dublin Core for museum information. 
                Recommendations expressed in the Guide are based on the experiences 
                of the Testbed participants and are designed to assist the reader 
                with several tasks, including: how the Dublin Core standard can 
                be applied to museum information; mapping existing data elements 
                sets to the Dublin Core element set; the creation of Dublin Core 
                records via manual or automated tools; implementing institutional 
                policies regarding information access and retrieval. It is intended 
                to be used by information managers, content experts and anyone 
                in the museum community involved with creating and disseminating 
                museum information</P>
              <P>In addition, the Guide mill be used in a series of workshops 
                designed for museum professionals. The first two of these workshops 
                will take place this fall - see the ICHIM99 (<A HREF="http://www.archimuse.com/ichim99/ichim99.html">http://www.archimuse.com/ichim99/ichim99.html</A>)
