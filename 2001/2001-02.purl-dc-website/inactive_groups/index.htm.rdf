   <dc:title>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative - Inactive Working Groups</dc:title>
   <dc:description>As the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative matures, Working Groups are deactivated either because their work has been completed, the issues are no longer being addressed, or because the group has decided to change the focus of the issues.  In any case, these deactiviated Working Groups remain part of the historical record of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.</dc:description>
