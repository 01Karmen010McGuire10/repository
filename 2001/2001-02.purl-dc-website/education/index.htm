                <P>The term <I>metadata</I> has been used only in the past 15 
                  years, and has become particularly common with the popularity 
                  of the World Wide Web. But the underlying concepts have been 
                  in use for as long as collections of information have been organized. 
                  Library catalogs represent a well established variety of metadata 
                  that has served for decades as collection management and resource

              <blockquote> 
                <p>&quot;Simple Dublin Core&quot; is a term often used to describe 
                  Dublin Core metadata that uses no qualifiers (see &quot;<a href="#18">Qualified 
                  Dublin Core</a>&quot; below). That is, the elements are expressed 
                  as attribute-value pairs using just the 15 elements from the 
                  <a href="../documents/rec-dces-19990702.htm">Dublin Core Metadata 
                  Element Set</a> without any further information about encoding 
                  schemes, enumerated lists of values, or other processing clues.</p>
                <p>The term &quot;unqualified Dublin Core&quot; is synonymous 
                  with &quot;simple Dublin Core.&quot;</p>

              <p><b><a name="18"></a>What is Qualified Dublin Core?</b></p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>&quot;Qualified Dublin Core&quot; is a term applied to Dublin 
                  Core metadata that employs additional information to increase 
                  the specificity of the metadata by refining the meaning , by 
                  specifying encoding schemes or controlled vocabularies, or to 
                  indicate a metadata value is a compound, or structured value.</p>
                <p>For example, a date may be further identified as a particular 
                  variety of date (date last modified, date published, etc.) and 
                  might be encoded according to a particular scheme that assures 
                  that it can be interpreted unambiguously. A subject term that 
                  is the value of the Subject element might be specified as having 
                  been selected from a particular controlled vocabulary such as 
                  the Dewey Decimal Classification.</p>
                <p>Qualifiers allow applications to increase the specificity or 
                  precision of the metadata, but also introduces complexity that 
                  can impair interoperability. Thus, designers of metadata systems 
                  are well advised to be conservative about deploying qualifiers 
                  in cases where interoperability is one of the design objectives.</p>
                <p>Dublin Core interoperability qualifiers are those which have 
                  been approved in the Dublin Core community and are a formal 
                  part of the registry of Dublin Core metadata. Designers should 
                  select qualifiers that come from this set to the extent that 
                  they meet the functional requirements for a given application.</p>
                <p>It is expected that local or application-specific requirements 
                  may well require additional qualifiers, or even additional elements, 
                  that have not been approved by the Dublin Core community at 
                  large. Deployment of local qualifiers and extensions is an appropriate 
                  action, but designers should do so with the understanding that 
                  interoperability with other applications may suffer. In cases 
                  where such additional qualifiers are being deployed, it may 
                  be helpful to bring this to the attention of the <a href="mailto:dc@oclc.org">Dublin 
                  Core Directorate</a> in order to promote the wider use of such 
                  qualifiers.</p>

              <blockquote> 
                <p>Anyone can use Dublin core elements as a convenient basis for 
                  descriptive systems. Web pages are one of the most common types 
                  of resources to have Dublin Core descriptions, often <a href="#7">using 
                  HTML meta tags</a>. But bulk conversions of descriptive information 
                  stored in older catalog systems and databases probably made 
                  up the largest number of Dublin Core descriptions in the early 
                  days of the initiative. Dublin Core metadata is being used as 
                  the basis for descriptive systems by several specialised communities 
                  and agencies: <a href="../groups/index.htm">community based 
                  interest groups </a>currently exist for education, libraries, 
                  government, and research. Also see the listing of <a href="../projects/index.htm">Dublin

              <BLOCKQUOTE> 
                <P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in <a href="../workshops/dc1conference/index.htm">1995</a> 
                  to develop conventions for resource discovery on the World Wide 
                  Web. The focus of discussion was electronic resources. It was 
                  clear at the outset, however, that the semantics of resource 
                  discovery should be independent of the medium of the resource, 
                  and that there are obvious advantages for using the same semantic 
                  model across media. Thus, considerable attention has been invested 
                  in making the Dublin Core sufficiently flexible to represent 
                  resources (and relationships among resources) that are both 
                  digital and exist in traditional formats as well.</P>

              <p><b><a name="19"></a>What is the Warwick Framework?</b></p>
              <blockquote> 
                
<p>The Warwick Framework is a conceptual model for metadata that recognizes that 
different packages of metadata, about the same thing, might be useful for different 
purposes and created, according to different standards or by different agencies. 
These will coexist, and mechanisms for generating and storing metadata should 
make allowances for this requirement. XML namespaces are one example of a tool 
which underpins the Warwick Framework approach.</p>
                <p>The Warwick Framework is not a system, but rather a set of 
                  design principles that have helped guide the development of 
                  the Dublin Core since the Second Dublin Core Metadata Workshop 
                  in Warwick, UK. Please read &quot;<a href="http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july96/07weibel.html">The 
                  Warwick Metadata Workshop: A Framework for the Deployment of 
                  Resource Description</a>&quot; for more information.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><b><a name="6"></a>How can I store Dublin Core Metadata?</b></p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is a set of semantic definitions 
                  of 15 descriptive elements. This means that many different methods 
                  can be used to actually record or transfer Dublin Core metadata. 
                  Common methods include HTML, XML, RDF and relational databases.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there are various limitations associated with 
                  the different methods that should be taken into account if planning 
                  a system.</p>
                <p>For example, <a href="#7">HTML</a> is convenient since it keeps 
                  the metadata embedded together with a document content, but 
                  only supports a simple list of meta elements, with no grouping 
                  or other structure.</p>
                <p>XML allows much more structured data to be recorded, and mechanisms 
                  such as XML namespaces can add value. However, there are few 
                  software applications available to use XML encoded data yet, 
                  and those that exist require considerable configuration or programming.</p>
                <p><a href="#8">RDF</a>, which was developed partly by people 
                  from the Dublin Core community, probably has the greatest expressive 
                  potential, but software to support RDF is currently experimental.</p>
                <p>For best performance in searching and retrieval, it is probably 
                  best to load DC metadata into a database management system, 
                  but this then forces the detachment of the metadata from the 
                  resource which it describes, so system designers must be careful

                <P>Dublin Core Metadata and RDF are distinct specifications. Neither 
                  requires the other, but their co-evolution make them natural 
                  complements in the metadata architecture for the Web. The Dublin 
                  Core community and the RDF community have a number of members 
                  in common, and they have evolved together. The Dublin Core community, 
                  in fact, provided many (but not all) of the basic requirements 
                  that were used to design RDF. In turn, the development of RDF 
                  provided the Dublin Core community with a much more formal underlying 
                  data model which has helped the DC community find principled 
                  solutions (rather than ad hoc Band-Aids) for many of the detailed 
                  problems that arise in deployment.</P>

              <p><b><a name="9"></a>What is the Dublin Core datamodel?</b></p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>A datamodel is an abstract representation of the part of the 
                  world that a system is designed to service. It typically includes 
                  its <b>scope - </b>i.e. an indication of the range of objects 
                  of interest to the system; the <b>properties </b>of things which 
                  are in-scope, and some kind of specification of <b>interactions</b> 
                  between them.</p>
                <p>The RDF datamodel is quite simple</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>&quot;things have properties&quot;, where each property 
                    has a name and a value. The &quot;atom&quot; of RDF, therefore, 
                    has three components: the thing (<b>resource</b>, in web terminology), 
                    a <b>property name</b>, and a <b>property value</b>.</li>
                  <li>each resource may have several of these properties.</li>
                  <li>the <i>value</i> may itself be a resource.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dublin Core builds on RDF by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>defining 15 named properties - the Dublin Core Metadata 
                    Element Set - which are considered to be widely useful for 
                    resource discovery.</li>
                  <li>specifying that a resource may have any number, including 
                    zero, of each of these properties (<b>elements</b>, in DC 
                    terminology).</li>
                  <li>defining the range of resource types that may have DC descriptions 
                    - given by the allowed values for the DCMES Type element.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>which defines the basic Dublin Core datamodel.</p>
                <p>Several of the 15 DC elements record relationships between 
                  the resource-of-interest and another resource which is in-scope 
                  for DC. In particular, Relation and source are used to indicate 
                  a connection with another resource of any type. Creator, Contributor 
                  and Publisher relate the present resource to a <i>party</i> 
                  who has some responsibility for it. Coverage relates the present 
                  resource to a <i>place</i> or to a time-period. The Value recorded 
                  for each of these elements, therefore, should normally be strictly 
                  an <i>identifier</i> of another resource, which could, in principle, 
                  have its own DCMES description. In this way, it is possible 
                  that a <i>web</i> of DC descriptions of resources will be constructed, 
                  with each <i>resource</i> at the centre of a fan of descriptive 
                  arcs, but connected via one of these relationships to other 
                  resources with their own fans. Of course, the &quot;identifiers&quot; 
                  will, in many cases, use an informal notation in plain-text.</p>
                <p>However, many users have found it useful to add extra information 
                  to Dublin Core descriptions, in particular:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>values are frequently drawn from a controlled vocabulary 
                    (e.g. a keyword list, such as Library of Congress Subject 
                    Headings, LCSH), or written using a special notation (e.g. 
                    the ISO8601 format for dates and times), or use a particular 
                    natural language (in the case of values written in text-strings), 
                    so it would make the information more useful if a client were 
                    informed of the source of this vocabulary, the definition 
                    of the notation, or the name of the language used.</li>
                  <li>an instance of an element may be used in a specialised way, 
                    with more restricted semantics than implied by the broad definition 
                    of the element (e.g. the Date might be the date a resource 
                    was <i>modified</i>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To encompass these requirements, the <i>qualified</i> Dublin 
                  Core datamodel also includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>value qualifiers - to store an identifier for the vocabulary, 
                    encoding or language of the value.</li>
                  <li>element qualifiers - to refine the meaning of the element. 
                    A DCMES element qualified with an element qualifier is, effectively, 
                    a &quot;new&quot; element or property, with a more specialised 
                    meaning than its parent element.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note, however, that it is not possible to create a new Dublin 
                  Core element with a meaning that goes beyond the meaning of 
                  the meaning of elements in the DCMES. To extend a description 
                  beyond that supported by DCMES, other mechanisms must be used.</p>

                <p>As its name implies, the Dublin Core is a starting place, not 
                  a final word. It is expected that local applications will add 
                  elements to meet local or community needs. Local extensions 
                  should be clearly distinguished from the Dublin Core through 
                  the use of a notational mechanism, such as using a prefix or 
                  namespace. Elements which are part of a local extension will 
                  not normally be useful to others that they have not been subject 
                  to the cross-community consensus building process that has brought 
                  the Dublin Core element set to its current state. Implementors 
                  are, however, encouraged to bring such elements to the attention 
                  of the community so that others might adopt them as judged necessary, 
                  leading possibly to eventual approval as additional Dublin Core 
                  elements.</p>

<P>The 1:1 rule expresses the notion that a discrete resource should have a discrete

resources are often not so discrete (Should each photograph in an article have 
its own record? What about collections of articles? Can the collection be thought 
of as a resource? What about multimedia objects?)</P>
                <P>Some in the Dublin Core community now believe that the 1:1 
                  principle should be revisited, and a working group will address
