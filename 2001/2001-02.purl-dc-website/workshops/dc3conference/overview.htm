<H1 ALIGN="center">Workshop on Metadata for Networked Images</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="center">September 24-25, 1996
<BR>Online Computer Library Center, Inc.
<BR>Dublin, Ohio, USA</H3>
<P><B>Overview</B></P>
<P>The Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) and OCLC are organizing 
                an invitational workshop in Dublin, Ohio on September 24 and 25 
                to promote convergence among alternative approaches to describing 
                images and imagebases in networked environments. This workshop 
                will build upon the outcomes of a workshop that OCLC organized 
                last fall to address the general issue of metadata in networked 
                environments. It will address the metadata requirements of networked 
                images and imagebases by refining and extending the &quot;Dublin 
                core&quot; of metadata elements that resulted from that previous 
                workshop.</P>
              <P>Digital images ranging from paintings and buildings to CAT scans and x-rays 
                to planetary landscapes and astronomical objects are now available 
                in great numbers on the Internet, and more such images are becoming 
                available every day. Widely accepted and used standards for describing 
                these images and their associated imagebases are urgently needed 
                to facilitate the planning of image creation and conversion projects 
                and to enable the discovery of existing images that can be used 
                in research, teaching, and learning activities. This workshop 
                will bring together a critical mass of experts who are working 
                in this area so that they can share information on their respective 
                efforts and clear the ground on which image and imagebase metadata 
                standards will be built.</P>
<P>The workshop will focus on still images, such as photographs, 
                slides, and graphics. It will not deal with moving images, such 
                as films, videos, and simulations, nor will it deal with images 
                of textual objects, such as page facsimiles. It will, however, 
                capture
<BR>the requirements of the wide range of disciplines (e.g. art, architecture, 
                engineering, medicine, and the life, physical, and social sciences) 
                that create and use images and imagebases, and it will identify 
                the requirements that are common to all disciplines
<BR>versus those that are unique to individual disciplines.</P>
<P><B>Process</B></P>
<P>If you are interested in participating in this workshop then 
                please contact the person identified below on or before June 15, 
                1996 (a) to declare your interest in participating, (b) to describe 
                your experience to-date with creating or using digital images 
                or imagebases in networked environments, and, (c) to suggest key 
                issues or topics that should be addressed by the workshop, together 
                with your views on those issues and topics.</P>
              <P>If you know of a project or a person that you believe should 
                be represented at or invited to this workshop then please (a) 
                forward this call for statements of interest and experience as 
                soon as possible to a representative of the project or to the 
                person you have in mind, or (b) contact the person identified 
                below as soon as possible with the title of the project or the 
                name of the person you have in mind together with a brief description 
                of the reason why you think a representative of that project or 
                that person should participate.</P>
<P>CNI and OCLC are particularly interested in receiving statements 
                from and nominations of faculty members, researchers, and other 
                &quot;content&quot; originators and users so that the workshop 
                might benefit from their participation as well as that of archivists, 
                librarians, information technologists, and other professional 
                developers and managers of information infrastructures, resources, 
                and services.</P>
<P>There will be no registration fee for this workshop. CNI and 
                OCLC will take responsibility for all staff, speaker, materials, 
                facility, and food expenses arising from this workshop. The workshop 
                participants will be responsible for their individual travel and 
                housing expenses.</P>

<P><B>Additional Information</B></P>
<P>CNI, a joint project of the Association for Research Libraries, 
                CAUSE, and Educom, was founded in March, 1990 to promote the creation 
                of and access to information resources in networked environments 
                in order to enrich scholarship and to enhance intellectual productivity.</P>
<P>OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) is a non-profit computer 
                library service and research organization whose computer network 
                and services link more that 22,000 libraries in 63 countries and 
                territories. Additional information about OCLC and its services 
                can be found at &lt;URL:<A HREF="http://www.oclc.org">http://www.oclc.org</A>&gt;</P>
<P>Currently 212 organizations and institutions, including OCLC, 
                belong to the CNI Task Force, a group that makes special contributions 
                to the Coalition's projects and activities. Included in the Task 
                Force membership are higher education institutions,
<BR>publishers, network service providers, computer hardware and system 
                companies, library networks and organizations, and public and 
                state libraries.</P>
<P>Periodically CNI issues a call for statements of interest and 
                experience as a vehicle for announcing initiatives in a manner 
                that promotes the widest and fairest possible identification of 
                institutions, organizations, and individuals willing and able 
                to contribute to those initiatives. Each call provides a brief 
                description of the initiative in question, and some calls include 
                supporting documents.</P>
<P>Individuals do not have to be affiliated with or employed by 
                a member of the CNI Task Force, or of ARL, CAUSE, or Educom, to 
                respond to a call for statements of interest and experience.</P>
<P>Statements of interest and experience are reviewed by CNI staff 
                with the assistance of the leaders of relevant CNI Working Groups 
                and the guidance of members of the CNI Steering Committee. Other 
                parties are involved as needed. Additional information is sometimes 
                requested during this review process.</P>
<P>Reviews of statements of interest and experience are carried 
                out in as expeditious and as flexible a fashion as possible, taking 
                care to balance the benefits of a wide and fair search for individuals 
                able and willing to contribute to particular initiatives with 
                the
<BR>benefits of focused and timely action on those initiatives.</P>
<P>Upon selection of the individuals to participate in a given initiative, 
                CNI staff notify all those who submitted a response to the call 
                of their status.</P>
<P>Additional information about CNI and its program can be obtained 
                from the person identified above and from the following Internet
