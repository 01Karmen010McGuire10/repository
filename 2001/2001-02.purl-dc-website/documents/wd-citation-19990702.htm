<P><B>Status: Bibliographic Citation Working Group Working Draft</B></P><HR SIZE="1" noshade>
<P>I understand from the Guidelines for Dublin Core Working Groups 
                (draft 1.4) that once a Chair has established consensus within 
                the WG, the Group's recommendations should be circulated to the 
                <A HREF="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-general/">dc-general</A> 
                list for comment. Below, you will find our Recommendations. (Please 
                refer to <A HREF="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation">http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation</A> 
                if you would like to see who is in the Working Group and the discussions 
                behind the recommendations.) Comments should be posted to <A HREF="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-general/">dc-general</A> 
                by Monday 19 July.</P>
<H3>i) SCOPE OF THE WORKING GROUP</H3>
<P>We agreed to focus on the metadata of the bibliographic record 
                of the resource, not the metadata of citations (references) to 
                the resource.</P>
<H3>ii) MATTERS TO BE ADDRESSED</H3>
<P>We agreed that we should limit ourselves to two specific questions 
                raised in the meta2 discussion lists last year, namely a) how 
                to indicate journal article metadata in a bibliographic record, 
                covering the article's location within a journal title, volume, 
                issue and pages, and b) how to indicate edition/version/release 
                information in a resource's bibliographic record.</P>
<H3>iii) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR JOURNAL ARTICLE INFORMATION</H3>
<P>We recommend that the most appropriate place for this information 
                is DC.Relation.</P>
<P>We also considered Title, Description, Identifier and Source, 
                but these were rejected in favour of Relation. DC.Title should 
                contain the article title but no other locational information. 
                DC.Identifier should contain one or more identifiers for the article 
                itself (e.g. the article SICI, PII, DOI, URL, etc.) but should 
                not contain identifiers to the issue, volume or journal.</P>
<P>The major discussion centred around whether the most appropriate 
                DC tag was Relation or Source. Some arguments were put forward 
                that, for the electronic version of an article, DC.Source could 
                be used to identify the print &quot;original&quot; (i.e. with 
                Journal, Volume, Issue and Pages), and this is a common implementation 
                practice, but we rejected this argument on the basis that you 
                couldn't say which version was derived from which other version. 
                The electronic version *may* be derived from the print (e.g. by 
                a process of back-conversion from typeset files to HTML) or the 
                print may derive from the electronic: how do you know what processes 
                have taken place? The print may be released before the electronic, 
                or vice versa, or they may be released simultaneously. And what 
                if there is only the one version - only print or only electronic?</P>
<P>Some implementers made a distinction between using Source when 
                the electronic was derived from print and Relation when the resource 
                only ever appeared in an electronic version. However, we regarded 
                this distinction as essentially arbitrary and reliant upon information 
                that wouldn't always be available, so we recommend that Relation 
                is used, whether the material is published first in print or not.</P>
<P>The Working Group was not constrained into considering DC Simple 
                (DC 1.0) solutions only, which would be very restrictive as far 
                as specifying Relations go. On the other hand, DC Qualified is 
                of course not yet stable, so any recommendations we make that 
                use qualifiers are subject to future stabilisation.</P>
<P>We recommend using the &quot;IsPartOf&quot; construct. The full 
                location information should be given as both a text string and 
                one or more identifiers *to the resource that the article is a 
                part of*. The text string should include the page range (or equivalent 
                locational information in a non-page-based resource) - even though 
                it could be argued that logically the article is not a *part* 
                of a page range (it *spans* a page range rather than is subsumed 
                within it), we recommend this practice because a) the page range 
                appears naturally at the end of journal bibliographic information, 
                b) we suspect implementers will put it there anyway, and c) they'll 
                do this because there's nowhere else for it to go.</P>
<P>For example, let's say we have an article in the Journal of the 
                American Society for Information Science, Volume 47, Issue 1, 
                starting on Page 37. The SICI for this article is 1097-4571(199601)47:1&lt;37::AID-ASI4&gt;3.0.CO;2-3. 
                The DOI is the SICI preceded by 10.1002/(SICI). The URL is the 
                DOI preceded by http://doi.wileynpt.com/.</P>
<P>In the DC record for the article, we would have the above SICI, 
                DOI and URL all entered under DC.Identifier (with the appropriate 
                Schemes indicated in DC Qualified).</P>
<P>The text string for DC.Relation &quot;IsPartOf&quot; would be 
                &quot;Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 
                Volume 47, Issue 1, Page 37&quot;. (The complete page range could 
                also be included.) DC Qualified might break this down into subelements. 
                (We would recommend explicit subelements such as JournalTitle, 
                JournalVolume, JournalIssue, and JournalPages.)</P>
<P>The identifiers within DC.Relation &quot;IsPartOf&quot; could 
                be (again with appropriate Scheme designations): &quot;1097-4571(199601)47:1&lt;&gt;1.0.CO;2-T&quot; 
                (for the SICI of the Issue that the article is a part of);
<BR>&quot;10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199601)47:1&lt;&gt;1.0.CO;2-T (for 
                the DOI of the Issue that the article is part of); and http://doi.wileynpt.com/10.1002 
                [and so on]&quot; for the URL of the Issue that the article is 
                part of.</P>
<H3>iv) RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EDITION/VERSION/RELEASE</H3>
<P>We recommend that this information should go into DC.Title.</P>
<P>Other options that we considered were Description, Identifier, 
                and Relation &quot;IsVersionOf&quot;.</P>
<P>Recommended subelement would be DC.Title.Release, whether we 
                were referring to editions, versions or releases, since this was 
                felt to be the most generic term.</P>
<P>DC.Identifier should contain the relevant identifier of the release 
                itself, e.g. the ISBN of a 2nd edition of a title, but would not 
                indicate release enumeration (e.g. it would not say &quot;2nd 
                edition&quot; or &quot;edition 2&quot; or &quot;2&quot; in the 
                Identifier field - this goes into Title).</P>
<P>DC.Relation &quot;IsVersionOf&quot; can be used to refer back 
                to previous versions but not to indicate the edition/version of 
                the current resource.</P>
<H3>
<BR>v) CONCLUSIONS</H3>
<P>a) We limited our scope to bibliographic records.</P>
<P>b) We concentrated on two issues that had been specifically raised 
                in
<BR>previous discussion groups, and for which no conclusions had been 
                reached.</P>
<P>c) We recommend the use of DC.Relation &quot;IsPartOf&quot; for 
                journal article placement information, i.e. for indicating which 
                journal, volume, issue and pages an article belongs to. This tag 
                should be used whether the article started life as a print product 
                or as an electronic one. The Relation can also refer to various 
                Identifiers of the journal issue of which the article is part.</P>
<P>d) Edition/version/release information ought to be part of DC.Title. 
                As a subelement, we recommend DC.Title.Release (which recommendation 
                has already been passed on to the Title Working Group).</P>
<P>If there are no further comments by 19 July, I will pass the 
                recommendations on to TAC (or, more correctly, the recently constituted 
                DC-AC).</P>
