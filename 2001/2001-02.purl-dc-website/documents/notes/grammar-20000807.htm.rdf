   <dc:title>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative - A Grammar of Dublin Core</dc:title>
   <dc:description>Dublin Core is often presented as a modern form of catalog card -- a set of elements (and now qualifiers) that describe resources in a complete package. Sometimes it is proposed as an exchange format for sharing records among multiple collections. The founding principle that "every element is optional and repeatable" reinforces the notion that a Dublin Core description is to be taken as a whole. This paper, in contrast, is based on a much different premise: Dublin Core is a language. More precisely, it is a small language for making a particular class of statements about resources. Like natural languages, it has a vocabulary of word-like tokens; two classes of tokens that reflect their function within statements -- elements and qualifiers, analogous to nouns and adjectives; and a syntax for arranging words into statements according to a simple pattern. </dc:description>
