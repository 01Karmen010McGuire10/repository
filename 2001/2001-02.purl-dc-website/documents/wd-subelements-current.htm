<P>This report is a record of the efforts of the Subelement working group constituted following the Helsinki Dublin Core Metadata Workshop (DC-5) of 
October, 1997. The recommendations are provisional and can be expected to evolve in the light of further implementation experience.</P>
<P>Although simplicity remains one of the fundamental tenets of the Dublin Core metadata initiative, a significant body of the stakeholder community believes 
that the option to refine the semantics of the element set through the addition of qualifiers is essential to allow effective deployment of the Dublin Core for 
resource discovery.  To address these shortcomings, the qualifiers SUBELEMENT, SCHEME and LANG were proposed at the 4th Dublin Core workshop in Canberra, Australia. 
These optional qualifiers, now known as the 'Canberra Qualifiers', are:</P>
<P><B>SUBELEMENT</B>, which allows the refinement and clarification of an element's content, such as, for example, refining the definition of DATE into Date Created, Date Acquired, etc.</P>
<P><B>SCHEME</B>, which allows an element's value to be identified as part of an existing classification system, coding scheme, glossary or thesaurus, such as the Dewey 
Decimal Classification for books or the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus for cultural heritage.</P>
<P><B>LANG</B>, which specifies the base language of an element's attribute values and text content; it is recommended that the values for this element are compliant 
with the scheme for creating language tags described by RFC 1766.</P>
<P>By optionally applying any or all of these qualifiers to the 15 elements of the Dublin Core, more detailed and semantically specific information about a 
resource can be encoded, thus assisting precision in the discovery and retrieval process for systems that support the use of these qualifiers.  The Subelement working 
group spent most time addressing the first of these qualifiers, SUBELEMENT, although some attention was also devoted both to the other qualifiers and to issues 
considered generic to all three. This report details only the work on the SUBELEMENT qualifier.</P>
<P>Whilst complex applications of Dublin Core are likely to have differing requirements for specialist SUBELEMENTs, early implementers frequently 
identified a common requirement for certain key SUBELEMENTs. Rather than encourage proliferation of these common SUBELEMENTs, with each application 
employing slightly different nomenclature and semantics, the most commonly utilised SUBELEMENTs identified to date are gathered together below, and 
presented in a standardised form. As can be seen, most of the 15 elements remain unqualified.</P>
<P><B>TITLE</B>
<BR>The Dublin Core TITLE element has the following subelements:</P>
<P>Alternative
<BR>Used for any titles other than the main title; including subtitle, translated title, series title, vernacular name, etc.</P>
