   <dc:title>Recording qualified Dublin Core metadata in HTML meta elements</dc:title>
   <dc:description>The Dublin Core metadata Element Set (DCMES) allows much descriptive 
information about resources to be expressed. However, in some applications it is 
desirable to refine the meanings of the DCMES metadata. A method for refining DCMES is 
encompassed in an extended model known as Qualified Dublin Core metadata, which 
requires additional labels and data, known generically as qualifiers.  In this recommendation 
we describe the methods provided directly by HTML, and explain how to record Qualified DCMES 
metadata in HTML using the meta element in the document head.</dc:description>
