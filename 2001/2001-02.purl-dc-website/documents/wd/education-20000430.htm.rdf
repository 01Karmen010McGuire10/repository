   <dc:title>Education working group: draft proposal</dc:title>
   <dc:description>This document is a Draft Proposal of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, 
and is intended to reflect consensus reached within the Education Working Group of the DCMI. 
It reports decisions reached by DCEd through its online discussions and face-to-face meetings 
in Frankfurt (October 25-27, 1999) and Melbourne (February 19-20, 2000). A full report in 
support of this Final Working Draft Proposal may be found in the DCEd Report of Deliberations. 
DCEd proposes: (1) two new domain-specific elements with accompanying element qualifiers for 
adoption; and (2) endorsement of three elements from the Instructional Management System (IMS) 
namespace (pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding with the IEEE Learning Object Metadata 
(LOM) working group).</dc:description>
