   <dc:title>Education working group: draft proposal</dc:title>
   <dc:description>This document is a Proposal from the Dublin Core Education Working 
Group [DCEd] 
to the Dublin Core Usage Committee of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative 
[DCMI]. The content of 
this document is intended to reflect the consensus reached 
within DCEd. It reports decisions reached 
by DCEd through its online discussions 
and face-to-face meetings in Frankfurt (October 25-27, 1999) 
and Melbourne (February 
19-20, 2000). A <em>Report of Deliberations</em> is referenced throughout in 
support 
of the Proposal. DCEd proposes the adoption of the following: (1) two new domain-specific 

elements with accompanying element qualifiers for a dc-ed namespace; and (2) a 
new domain-specific 
qualifier to dc:relation for the dc-ed namespace. In addition, 
DCEd proposes the endorsement of three 
elements from the Instructional Management 
Systems (IMS) namespace (pursuant to the Memorandum of 
Understanding with IEEE 
LTSC).</dc:description>
