   <dc:title>DCMI Box Encoding Scheme: specification of the spatial limits of a place, and methods for encoding this in a string.</dc:title>
   <dc:description>We introduce DCMI Box for identifying a 
                      region of space using its geographic limits. Components 
                      of the value correspond to the bounding coordinates in north, 
                      south, east and west directions, plus optionally up and 
                      down, and also allow the coordinate system and units to 
                      be specified, and a name if desired. We describe a method 
                      for encoding DCMI Box in a text-string, as a profile of 
                      DCSV. This notation is intended for recording the value 
                      of the DCMES element Coverage, particularly when 
                      using HTML meta elements. We also show an alternative encoding 
                      for DCMI Box using XML. </dc:description>
