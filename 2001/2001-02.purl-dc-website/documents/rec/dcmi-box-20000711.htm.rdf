   <dc:title>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative - DCMI Box Encoding Scheme</dc:title>
   <dc:creator>Simon Cox</dc:creator>
   <dc:description>The DCMI Box encoding scheme is a method for 
                    identifying a region of space using its geographic limits. 
                    Components of the value correspond to the bounding coordinates 
                    in north, south, east and west directions, plus optionally 
                    up and down, and also allow the coordinate system and units 
                    to be specified, and a name if desired. A method for encoding 
                    DCMI Box in a text-string, as a profile of DCSV is described. 
                    This notation is intended for recording the value of the DCMES 
                    element Coverage, particularly when using HTML meta 
                    elements. An alternative encoding for DCMI Box using XML is 
                    also shown.</dc:description>
