<P>AGLS was developed in late 1997 as the resource discovery metadata standard 
                for Australian governments and was endorsed for use by all levels 
                of government in Australia in November 1998. AGLS is a qualified 
                metadata standard based on Dublin Core, and consists of 19 elements 
                - the 15 DC elements plus an additional four that were considered 
                necessary in the Australian government context. AGLS goes beyond 
                DC in being aimed at resource discovery and retrieval and was 
                developed from the outset with the intention that it would be 
                used to describe both online and off-line government resources.</P>

<P>The MALVINE project opens new and enhanced access to disparate 
                holdings of modern manuscripts and letters, kept and catalogued 
                in European libraries, archives, documentation centers and museums. 
                The idea of MALVINE is to build a network of these institutions 
                in Europe; a network which is independent of heterogeneous technical 
                solutions (Detailed technical information) and which is accessible 
                from all over the world as if being a homogenous unified database. 
                A multilingual user interface will be provided, using an agreed 
                common terminology and will offer digitized surrogates of the 
                precious original documents.</P>

<P>Under the Taiwan Digital Museum Project (sponsored by the <A HREF="http://mars.csie.ntu.edu.tw/%7Edlm/">National

                photos, butterfly, etc.), and we adopted Dublin Core as our &quot;core

<P>The Australian Government's Business Entry Point (BEP) is an 
                initiative to make it easier for Australian businesses to deal 
                with government. It provides a gateway to regulations, services 
                and resources from the Federal Government and all Australian States 
                and Territories. The BEP's metadata is based on Dublin Core and 
                the Australian Government Locator Service, and is detailed at 
                <A HREF="http://about.business.gov.au/bep/agencies/provinfo/metadata/metadata.htm">http://about.business.gov.au/bep/agencies/provinfo/metadata/metadata.htm 
                </A>
<BR>Currently, all metadata is collected in a central database where 
                organisations register their content, but work is underway to 
                access metadata held remotely. Substantial work has also been

<P>The aim of this EU-funded project is to provide user-oriented, 
                  integrated network based access to mathematical publication. 
                  The EULER service intends to offer a "one-stop shopping site" 
                  for users interested in Mathematics. Using Dublin Core-based 
                  Metadata descriptions, EULER will integrate: Bibliographic databases; 
                  library online public access catalogues; electronic journals 
                  from academic publishers; online archives of preprints and grey 
                  literature; and indexes of mathematical Internet resources. 
                  A common user interface - the EULER Engine - will assist the 
                  user in searching for relevant topics in all sources at once.</P>

              <p>The Foundations Project is a State of Minnesota multi-agency 
                collaborative project aimed at improving public access to environmental 
                and natural resources data and information. The focus of the Project 
                is on developing intuitive and easy to use search tools and strategies. 
                Staff and agency participants catalog many kinds of electronic 
                information resources using qualified Dublin Core elements. These 
                resources can be used to develop advanced search and retrieval 
                techniques that integrate access to this information across agency 
                Web sites. The search interface is called Bridges (<a href="http://bridges.state.mn.us/">http://bridges.state.mn.us/</a>), 
                signifying the metaphorical spanning of information across Minnesota 
                state agencies. Based on project research findings and using principles 
                of information architecture, a &quot;blueprint&quot; specifying 
                best practices for Minnesota state environmental Web sites is 
                being created. As the Foundations Project nears completion, efforts 
                are in place to bring the successes and blueprint to the remaining 
                state agencies.</p>

<P>This Website is intended to help Web content providers 
                  improve the effectiveness of searching for information resources 
                  on the World Wide Web. Difficulties in finding scattered Web 
                  resources have prompted the development of simplified metadata 
                  standards which could be used by authors, or Web content creators/publishers, 
                  to facilitate easier access for Web users. The National Library 
                  encourages any initiative which seeks to implement standard 
                  metadata schemas such as the Dublin Core.</P>

                the Danish State Information Service have worked out a standard 
                describing how the publications shall be encoded. The publications 
                include guidelines for how to produce web publications. One recommendation 
                is for web publications to always have a HTML page with metadata 
                - human and machine-readable - even if the resource itself is

                with both quality-assured content and links to evaluated online 
                education resources. The site will continue to be developed and 
                expanded by the Trust over the next two years and the site invites

                seven countries on four continents. During the past 15 months,

                an arrary of items, collections, disciplines and cultural artifacts
