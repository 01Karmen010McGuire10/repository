Leif,

I am copying this to the entire group as I will be on
vacation as of Tuesday 6 April and Rachel and Makx will want
to expand on this text for the agenda.  The part of the agenda
description for WI4 regarding ISSS/WS-MMI-DC/102 should read:

    Tom Baker will present the first draft of
    ISSS/WS-MMI-DC/102, "Guidance for naming, versioning,
    evolution and maintenance of element declarations and
    application profiles".  As Erik Duval has needed to
    withdraw from the activity for family reasons, Task
    2.1 will cover the description only of DCMI policies,
    not of IEEE/LOM.

Leif, are you proposing the mappings as candidates for
machine-processable DCAPs?

The expression of the metadata set in DC and IEEE LOM would be useful
background for CWA1, and as such could I hope could be considered
contribution in kind?  I don't think we want to commit to using this, or
any other particular DCAP as basis for example machine-processable DCAP at
this stage....

Conversion between DC and LOM is not a trivial undertaking.
I do not recall it having been part of WI4...?

Dear all,

As a basis for discussion, here is ISSS/WS-MMI-DC/102:
"Guidance for naming, versioning, evolution and maintenance of
element declarations and application profiles -- First draft".

The general approach I have taken here is to provide in
Section 1 a narrative overview of the naming and identification
methods, commenting on their historical context.  After the
obligatory definitions in Section 2, then, I will provide a
rather terse technical discussion in Section 3.

Note that there are placeholders for the bits dealing with
Application Profiles, which will depend on discussion in Work
Item 4, Part One on machine-processable Application Profiles.
Section 4 was to discuss differences between the DCMI approach
and the approaches taken by other standards-making initiatives,
such as W3C, ISO 11179, and OASIS.  In particular, the section
was ideally going to discuss differences on these issues
with regard to interoperability between DC and IEEE/LOM,
but this will depend on the availability of Erik over the
next few months.

I recently joined the W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and
Deployment Working Group [1] and proposed that the working
group take on a number of the issues discussed in this CEN
draft as input into a W3C Note on best practice.  It is my hope
that the CEN draft could be cited and summarized in such a note
as an example of best practice for the Semantic Web generally.

In Brussels, I would like for us to agree on the scope and on
the terminology used as labels for the things described.  I am
expecting that the technical content will be non-controversial
inasmuch it describes formal and de facto practice rather than
actually formulating new practice.

Executive Summary

These guidelines describe the principles and methods
for identifying metadata terms, sets of metadata terms,
and application profiles. [will expand]

1. Introduction

1.1. Context

The Internet was revolutionary because it made the resources
of any connected server accessible via a single global address
space.  The vision of a future Semantic Web further generalizes
this notion of a global space of addresses to that of a global
space of identifiers.  According to Tim Berners-Lee, "The
most fundamental specification of Web architecture, while one
of the simpler, is that of the Uniform Resource Identifier,
or URI.  The principle that anything, absolutely anything
'on the Web' should be identified distinctly by an otherwise
opaque string of characters...  is core" [BERNERS-LEE].

URIs can provide unique identity not just to "information
resources" -- Web pages, scientific pre-prints, satellite
photos, video clips, and the like -- but also to any metadata
terms used to describe those resources.  As compact character
strings associated with known institutional domain authorities,
URIs can stand alone as self-contained references to metadata
terms.  While relevant to all data technologies, they are
usable most directly in Web-based description technologies
such as XLink, Topic Maps, and RDF.

When the Dublin Core was first drafted in 1995, discussion
focused on the "names" of the core elements.  As the
Dublin Core came to be considered for use with the emerging
technologies of XML and later RDF, discussion began to turn
around the notion of a "namespace".  "Namespace" was, and
remains today, a rather slippery concept.  For the purposes
of this CWA suffice it to say that "namespace" captures the
notion of a clearly identified set of terms.  DCMI began
to experiment with using URIs to identify the Dublin Core
"namespace" in 1997.  The growth of DCMI's namespace (or
namespaces) with the addition of several dozen qualifiers
in 2000 forced a clarification of various issues related to
naming, identifying, and versioning DCMI terms.  In 2001,
the approach which had evolved was articulated in a formal DCMI
Namespace Policy.

The Namespace Policy declares three "DCMI namespaces"
-- identifiers (URIs) for three DCMI term sets.  URIs
for individual DCMI terms are formed by appending the
character-string "name" of the term to the URI for its DCMI
namespace.  This mechanism is discussed in more detail below.

Aside from describing how DCMI terms are assigned identifiers,
the namespace policy acknowledges that terms can and will
change over time and focuses on articulating the consequences
of change for unique identity.  "Minor" or "substantive" errata
may be corrected without consequence for URIs.  Changes of a
semantic nature, however, such as significant changes in the
wording of a definition, must trigger the creation of a new
term with a new URI.  To support the future interpretation
of legacy metadata, the Namespace Policy commits DCMI to
maintaining formal documentation for all assigned URIs ---
even for terms that might some day be assigned a status of
"obsolete".

Within the limits of the Namespace Policy, the DCMI
vocabularies are subject to growth and change over time ---
new terms are added, a bibliographic reference cited in a
usage comment may be updated, the status assigned to a term
may change.  The fifteen-element Dublin Core was initially
versioned as a set and, as noted above, the version number
"1.1" is hard-coded into the string used as the URI
of its DCMI namespace.

As of July 2000, new terms were issued without such a version
number because the model of periodic, batched releases
seemed a bad fit to a vocabulary that was expected to grow
by increment.  At the same time, the ability to reference a
term set as of a given date was seen as potentially useful
for library automation contracts, translations of DCMI term
sets into another languages, or the future interpretation
of legacy metadata.  The pragmatic solution to this problem
has been to version both individual terms (which evolve at
different rates) and Web pages which document batches of terms
as of a particular date (which are updated whenever a term is
added or anything else in the term set changes).  DCMI uses
URIs to identify both the individual versions of terms and
the Web pages documenting term sets, though these methods
have not yet been documented in detail (hence this CWA).

[Paragraph explaining the principle of having a persistent
identifier for the "term" in its "latest version" in parallel
with a second identifier denoting a specific historical
version.]

Whenever anything in the DCMI term sets changes, DCMI publishes
documentation reflecting those changes.  At present, DCMI
publishes the updated information both as Web documents and
as machine-processable schemas.  The DCMI Namespace Policy
also says that all of the URIs identifying DCMI terms "will
resolve to a machine-processable DCMI term declaration for
all the terms within that namespace" [DCMIN].  As of July
2003, the URIs for DCMI terms redirect to an RDF schema
documenting the attributes of a particular set of terms
[DCMIT]. The formulation is vague enough to support any
alternative conventions for namespace resolution that may
emerge, such as the Resource Directory Description Language
under consideration by the W3C Technical Architecture Group
[RDDL].  These documentary publications are named and versioned
like most other documents on the DCMI Web site.

[Paragraph explaining the principle of two identifiers, as
above, drawing the parallel between how documents are versioned
and how terms are versioned.]

In the DCMI context, the notion of Application Profile emerged
in response to a strong though vaguely expressed need for
documenting and sharing metadata models within communities
of interest.  Application Profiles have been developed for
purposes ranging from the description of existing record
structures to the negotiation of good-practice guidelines for
formats yet to be implemented.  Application Profiles have
helped identify emerging semantics "around the edges" of
existing vocabularies as candidates for formal standardization.
[Discuss Guidelines for Application Profiles, CWA 14855.]

Application designers often draw on standards such as Dublin
Core rather freely, selecting a a subset of available terms,
specifying constraints on how terms are used (e.g., which
elements are mandatory, which date format to use), or using
terms from multiple sources --- e.g., Dublin Core elements
together with elements from the IEEE/LOM standard or with
elements defined in-house for application-specific purposes.
In order to document such practices, standards communities
as different as DCMI, DOI, MARC, and IEEE/LOM have developed
roughly analogous notions of a "profile" or "application
profile".  [A number of key standards maintenance organizations
have agreed in principle characterizing the "elements" of the
various standards as "units of meaning comparable and mappable
to elements of other standards".  [CORES].  [In Semantic Web
environment, where mixing of term sets, important to have
well-understood conventions on what is being identified, etc.]
[This section will need to be fleshed out in light of the work
on Work Item 1, Part One.]

[Final section on "translations" as a particular form of
application profile.  Requirement to be able to cite the
exact version translated.]

1.2. Scope

This CWA covers naming conventions for the following entities:

-- a metadata term ("Term");
-- a historical version of a Term ("Term Version");
-- a set of one or more annotations (e.g., usage constraints) about a Term ("Term Usage");
-- a set of one or more Terms ("Term Set");
-- a document documenting a Term Set ("Term-Set Document");
-- a formal schema (e.g., in RDF) declaring one or more Terms ("Term-Set Schema");
-- a set of one or more Term Usages ("Application Profile").

These entities are defined in more detail in "Section 2. Definitions".

1.3. Audience

[To be written.]

2. Definitions

-- Term
-- Term Version
-- Term Usage
-- Term Set
-- Term-Set Document
-- Term-Set Schema
-- Application Profile
-- DCMI Namespace
-- DCMI Name

3. Naming and identification methods in detail

3.1.  A metadata term ("Term")

DCMI began to experiment with URIs in 1997, which led
to the formulation in 2001 of a formal Namespace Policy
[DCMI-NAMESPACE].  This policy declares URIs for three DCMI
namespaces:

    http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
    http://purl.org/dc/terms/
    http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/

to designate (respectively) the fifteen-element Dublin Core,
all other DCMI elements and qualifiers, and a controlled
vocabulary of values for the Dublin Core element Type.
A URI is constructed for a DCMI term by appending its
character-string "name" to the URI of a DCMI namespace.
For example, the URIs

    http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title
    http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent
    http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Image

respectively identify Title (one of the fifteen "core"
elements), Extent (an element refinement) and Image (a term
in the DCMI Type Vocabulary).

   http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor
   http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection
   http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract
   http://purl.org/dc/terms/LCSH

3.2.  A historical version of a Term ("Term Version");

Individual terms are versioned by saving a snapshot of their
attributes whenever any one of their attributes changes and
assigning to that snapshot a URI such as the following:

    http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#Image-002
    http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#Image-001

Although such URIs are not currently supported by the DCMI
Namespace Policy, they effectively function as identifiers
for successive versions of a term (in this case Image).
At present, these URIs resolve to anchors in a Web document
which holds a periodically updated snapshot of all past and
present versions of all DCMI terms.

   http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#contributor-001
   http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#contributor-002
   http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#contributor-003
   http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#contributor-004

3.3. A set of one or more annotations (e.g., usage constraints)
     about a Term ("Term Usage");

[This section will depend on the terminology and approach
adopted in Part One of Work Item 4 on machine-processable
application profiles.  The working assumption is that this
work will affirm the terminology described in CWA14855.]

3.4. A set of one or more Terms ("Term Set")

Aside from the namespace for core elements, which predated
the Namespace Policy, the URIs for DCMI namespaces do not show
versioning information.  As of July 2000, new terms were issued
without such a version number because the model of periodic,
batched releases seemed a bad fit to a vocabulary that was
expected to grow by increment.  [Explain that Element Set is
versioned as a set both for historical reasons and in order
to emphasize the fundamental stability of the element set,
but that other sets are not versioned "as sets" (except
as documents).  Will elaborate.]

3.5. A document documenting a Term Set ("Term-Set Document")

[Expanding on 3.4.]

The Web pages documenting DCMI term sets are versioned
according to the method used for all other important DCMI
documents --- with a URI for the specific historical version
and a URI for its "latest version" along with pointers to
immediate previous and successive versions.  For example,
the March 2003 version of the DCMI Metadata Terms document
shows the following:

    Identifier: http://dublincore.org/documents/2003/03/04/dcmi-terms/
    Latest Version: http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms
    Replaced By: http://dublincore.org/documents/2003/11/19/dcmi-terms/

where the Identifier resolves to the permanently archived
and unchanging version of the document displayed, Replaced By
resolves to the next version that followed, and Latest Version
resolves to a continually updated pointer on the DCMI Web
site to the most up-to-date version of DCMI Metadata Terms.
In DCMI practice, in other words, the versioning methods for
metadata terms and for Web documents are analogous: in each
case, identifiers are assigned both for the resource in a
generic sense (the namespace-policy-supported URI for a term
or Latest Version for a document) as well as for a specific
historical version.

3.6. A formal schema (e.g., in RDF) declaring one or more
     Terms ("Term-Set Schema")

[Versioned according to the same principle as documents, etc.
Will elaborate.]

3.7. A set of one or more Term Usages ("Application Profile").

[This section will depend on the terminology and approach
adopted in Part One of Work Item 4 on machine-processable
application profiles.  The working assumption is that this
work will affirm the terminology described in CWA14855.]

4.0. Discussion and conclusion

[To be written.  This final section was going to recapitulate
some of the issues that came out in the discussion of the
CORES Resolution.  In particular, it was to discuss issues
related to the compatability in the approaches taken by DCMI
and by the IEEE LOM community to naming and identifying terms.

>
> Executive Summary
>
> These guidelines describe the principles and methods
> for identifying metadata terms, sets of metadata terms,
> and application profiles. [will expand]
>
> 1. Introduction
>
> 1.1. Context
>
> The Internet was revolutionary because it made the resources
> of any connected server accessible via a single global address
> space.  The vision of a future Semantic Web further generalizes
> this notion of a global space of addresses to that of a global
> space of identifiers.  According to Tim Berners-Lee, "The
> most fundamental specification of Web architecture, while one
> of the simpler, is that of the Uniform Resource Identifier,
> or URI.  The principle that anything, absolutely anything
> 'on the Web' should be identified distinctly by an otherwise
> opaque string of characters...  is core" [BERNERS-LEE].
>
> URIs can provide unique identity not just to "information
> resources" -- Web pages, scientific pre-prints, satellite
> photos, video clips, and the like -- but also to any metadata
> terms used to describe those resources.  As compact character
> strings associated with known institutional domain authorities,
> URIs can stand alone as self-contained references to metadata
> terms.  While relevant to all data technologies, they are
> usable most directly in Web-based description technologies
> such as XLink, Topic Maps, and RDF.
>
> When the Dublin Core was first drafted in 1995, discussion
> focused on the "names" of the core elements.  As the
> Dublin Core came to be considered for use with the emerging
> technologies of XML and later RDF, discussion began to turn
> around the notion of a "namespace".  "Namespace" was, and
> remains today, a rather slippery concept.  For the purposes
> of this CWA suffice it to say that "namespace" captures the
> notion of a clearly identified set of terms.  DCMI began
> to experiment with using URIs to identify the Dublin Core
> "namespace" in 1997.  The growth of DCMI's namespace (or
> namespaces) with the addition of several dozen qualifiers
> in 2000 forced a clarification of various issues related to
> naming, identifying, and versioning DCMI terms.  In 2001,
> the approach which had evolved was articulated in a formal DCMI
> Namespace Policy.
>
> The Namespace Policy declares three "DCMI namespaces"
> -- identifiers (URIs) for three DCMI term sets.  URIs
> for individual DCMI terms are formed by appending the
> character-string "name" of the term to the URI for its DCMI
> namespace.  This mechanism is discussed in more detail below.
>
> Aside from describing how DCMI terms are assigned identifiers,
> the namespace policy acknowledges that terms can and will
> change over time and focuses on articulating the consequences
> of change for unique identity.  "Minor" or "substantive" errata
> may be corrected without consequence for URIs.  Changes of a
> semantic nature, however, such as significant changes in the
> wording of a definition, must trigger the creation of a new
> term with a new URI.  To support the future interpretation
> of legacy metadata, the Namespace Policy commits DCMI to
> maintaining formal documentation for all assigned URIs ---
> even for terms that might some day be assigned a status of
> "obsolete".
>
> Within the limits of the Namespace Policy, the DCMI
> vocabularies are subject to growth and change over time ---
> new terms are added, a bibliographic reference cited in a
> usage comment may be updated, the status assigned to a term
> may change.  The fifteen-element Dublin Core was initially
> versioned as a set and, as noted above, the version number
> "1.1" is hard-coded into the string used as the URI
> of its DCMI namespace.
>
> As of July 2000, new terms were issued without such a version
> number because the model of periodic, batched releases
> seemed a bad fit to a vocabulary that was expected to grow
> by increment.  At the same time, the ability to reference a
> term set as of a given date was seen as potentially useful
> for library automation contracts, translations of DCMI term
> sets into another languages, or the future interpretation
> of legacy metadata.  The pragmatic solution to this problem
> has been to version both individual terms (which evolve at
> different rates) and Web pages which document batches of terms
> as of a particular date (which are updated whenever a term is
> added or anything else in the term set changes).  DCMI uses
> URIs to identify both the individual versions of terms and
> the Web pages documenting term sets, though these methods
> have not yet been documented in detail (hence this CWA).
>
> [Paragraph explaining the principle of having a persistent
> identifier for the "term" in its "latest version" in parallel
> with a second identifier denoting a specific historical
> version.]
>
> Whenever anything in the DCMI term sets changes, DCMI publishes
> documentation reflecting those changes.  At present, DCMI
> publishes the updated information both as Web documents and
> as machine-processable schemas.  The DCMI Namespace Policy
> also says that all of the URIs identifying DCMI terms "will
> resolve to a machine-processable DCMI term declaration for
> all the terms within that namespace" [DCMIN].  As of July
> 2003, the URIs for DCMI terms redirect to an RDF schema
> documenting the attributes of a particular set of terms
> [DCMIT]. The formulation is vague enough to support any
> alternative conventions for namespace resolution that may
> emerge, such as the Resource Directory Description Language
> under consideration by the W3C Technical Architecture Group
> [RDDL].  These documentary publications are named and versioned
> like most other documents on the DCMI Web site.

> [Paragraph explaining the principle of two identifiers, as

> and how terms are versioned.]
>
> In the DCMI context, the notion of Application Profile emerged

> documenting and sharing metadata models within communities
> of interest.  Application Profiles have been developed for

> [Discuss Guidelines for Application Profiles, CWA 14855.]
>
> Application designers often draw on standards such as Dublin
> Core rather freely, selecting a a subset of available terms,

> together with elements from the IEEE/LOM standard or with
> elements defined in-house for application-specific purposes.
> In order to document such practices, standards communities

Dear all,

There are three things we need to submit to Leif:

1. draft of CWA1
2. draft of CWA2
3. in-kind contribution prognosis

As I understand it, the draft of CWA1 is the progress report Rachel
circulated last week which says that a number of tasks are delayed.
Tom is ready to submit the draft of CWA2 as distributed to this list
earlier this afternoon, and the estimate of in-kind contributions is
as circulated last Tuesday and attached.

It seems to me that the easiest thing to do is that Rachel delivers
(1), Tom delivers (2) and I deliver (3) to Leif.

Makx.

To be precise the deliverable as mentioned in the WI4 workplan for CWA1 is
a 'Report to MMI-DC on progress', so I included in the draft a report on
progress.
see http://homes.ukoln.ac.uk/~lisrmh/CEN/mmidc-wi4-cwa1-v4.doc

Rachel,

The Nokia Vocabulary is described at

http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/?uri=http%3a%2f%2fsw.nokia.com%2fVOC-1&inferen
ce=exclude&format=text%2Fhtml&naming=label

so it defines classes like voc:Vocabulary and properties like voc:part
of and voc:term, which (I think) are fairly similar to our
cores:ElementSet and cores:isElementOf and so on.

I recall that I got very confused because he has a Vocabulary called

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1 (no trailing slash)

http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/?uri=http%3a%2f%2fpurl.org%2fdc%2felements%2f1
.1&inference=exclude&format=text%2Fhtml&naming=label

with a seeAlso reference to

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ (with trailing slash)

http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/?uri=http%3a%2f%2fpurl.org%2fdc%2felements%2f1
.1%2f&inference=exclude&format=text%2Fhtml&naming=label

which (I think) is the schema or document that defines the Vocabulary.

I did at some point get clear in my head which things were documents and
which things were Vocabularies, but it was a long time ago....!

Rachel,

I have meetings today and cannot comment in detail.  However,
one general point -- the term "machine-readable" seems somehow
inadequate.  A documentary sort of DCAP done up as a HTML
Web page is "machine-readable".  Maybe "machine-processable"
is not exactly what we need either, but we somehow need a
better handle to convey a distinction between the formal,
machine-processable, actionable, etc, schemas of this year's
CWA as opposed to machine-displayable documents of last
year's CWA.

Hello Rachel,

this helps to get me onwards. It seems that URIQA =
(http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/URIQA.html) is the name of the game, I will =
look into it and see what I can get out of it...

Thanks,
Thomas

I did at some point get clear in my head which things were documents and

You are correct. The document looks fine to me. If there are no
objections, I will submit the in-kind spreadsheet to Leif tomorrow.

I can live with these names although I do think process implies more
what is going on here than just readable. However, our computer legacy
tells us that machine-readable IS processable and always has been from
punch card days (Oh I remember them to well!).

This point should not block the view of the ongoing work but just
flagged to keep an eye on it as we go along or we will end up with that
biological urge us humans have to talk terminology!

Perhaps in the day of the semantic web and when the punch card has
rotted in its grave it is time to coil a new phrase altogether...

See you in a couple of weeks.

Rachel,

I have meetings today and cannot comment in detail.  However,
one general point -- the term "machine-readable" seems somehow
inadequate.  A documentary sort of DCAP done up as a HTML
Web page is "machine-readable".  Maybe "machine-processable"
is not exactly what we need either, but we somehow need a
better handle to convey a distinction between the formal,
machine-processable, actionable, etc, schemas of this year's
CWA as opposed to machine-displayable documents of last
year's CWA.

Hi Leif,

If it isn't too late to add to the agenda a small "matter
arising", I would like to briefly discuss the process by
which the CEN workshop can handle a forthcoming request for
changes to CWA 14855 from DCMI.  What is the CEN workshop
process by which the changes could be incorporated, approved,
and published in the official version?

In this case, the Usage Board will request a clarification of
one technical point and a slightly different rhetorical "spin"
on another point.  How should DCMI submit such a request?

Since I was the editor of CWA 14855, I assume I then could go
ahead and propose the changes in the CEN context.  Would I
then submit it to the full MMI-DC workshop for approval?
Could we do this by email or would we need to wait until the
next face-to-face meeting?

I would like to discuss this in Brussels strictly from a
process point of view as I will not have time to prepare or
present the actual changes.

Many thanks,
Tom
