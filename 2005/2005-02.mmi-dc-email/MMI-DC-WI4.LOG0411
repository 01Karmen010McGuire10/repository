Dear Martin,

I hope this finds you well.

I understand you had some discussion with Tom and Pete about
Task 4.3 and came to an agreement about its nature and scope
along the following lines:

That it would characterize in one page or so the nature of
GIS-related metadata requirements in a Dublin Core context
for a non-GIS-expert reader.

This would start by saying what sorts of data GIS implementers
want or need to put into DCAPs (i.e., into their metadata)
-- a sort of bird's-eye view of the types of data that GIS
implementers want to put into DCAPs.

Given the focus of WI4 on the RDF model, it would then
point out any GIS-specific types of data that fit uneasily
with the RDF model.  Does that data tend to take the form of
strings which need to be parsed (e.g., DCMI Box), specialized
XML schemas that need to pointed to, or something else?
How important to implementers are the DCSV specifications
"DCMI Point" and "DCMI Box"?

The summary would conclude by characterizing for the general
reader how GIS implementers tend to use Dublin Core -- as a
native metadata language including lots of GIS information
or as a simple target for lossy data export for the purposes
of interoperability.

These questions are all pretty basic -- presumably the sort
of thing you can answer from previous experience, work with
last year's CWAs, and a basic understanding of the RDF model
for machine-processable DCAPs.  According to the work plan,
however, we would need to have this annex within the next
two weeks or so to remain on-track to completing the task
as proposed.

Will you be able to provide the text as agreed?

Kind regards, Makx.

This is something I do not remember, and I am pretty sure that
no-one collected in-kind contribution forms at any of the workshop
meetings, or did I miss something?

I presented the Versioning work at three meetings (Usage Board,
Architecture, and SemWeb session) and there was discussion
-- and general approval -- at each.  How would one go about
capturing that?

The only thing that counts for CEN is signed forms. If we want to
capture the contributions from other people, we need to get them
to sign the forms.

This is really just a placeholder/prompt/reminder (to myself as much as
to anyone else!), but before publishing the final version of the
application profile document, we need to decide on URIrefs for the
properties/classes used in the RDF representation. (I think currently
they are all example.org HTTP URIrefs).

Has the public review/comment period expired now? Have we received the
final batch of comments?

With Martin's annex now available, it should be possible to finalise
CWA1.

According to the decisions of the September meeting, we need to
submit both CWAs on the 29th of December but I think we should aim
to get them delivered before Christmas.

Agreed. I know there are some comments on Martin's annex which I would
like some time to formulate and discuss. If we can be given time to do
that over the next week ?

According to plan we specifically mentioned circulation to DCMI and
IEEE... I suppose a mail to appropriate lists would fulfil this??

Rachel,

If you can send me the latest version, I can try to take care of the
"circulation" to IEEE. We might even get some useful feedback...

Would think so. I talked to Luc last week and he said we needed to
do a better job in getting people to download stuff.

Rachel

Thank you for the comments I will turn my attention to them on Monday.
Realistically, No I think December 3 will be too soon but I have yet to
read them.

I am wondering why you have collectively commented without me seeing the
exchange? That would have let me understood better.

I will look and let you know as soon as I can.

I hope you and all your team have a nice weekend.

Martin, I am forwarding our combined comments on Annex E which I hope you
will find helpful. The overall message is a request for clarification. As
you will see there is quite a lot of detailed comment to highlight where
and why that clarification is required.

I hope you will be able to do some re-working of the annex, keeping in
mind that as an annex it can be kept reasonably short. I would like to set
a deadline of Dec 3 if that is feasible for you? we are planning to
circulate the final version before the Christmas break.

Best wishes
Rachel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Martin,

Rachel, Makx, Pete, and I found ourselves uncertain as to what
the text is actually trying to do and we ended up talking
over the phone instead of the list.  This note merges the
more detailed comments we each were working on.

Basically, we were unsure whether your text is meant to do
the following:

a)  To comment on the suitability of a Dublin Core Application
    Profile for describing "a geospatial dataset" (seen as a
    resource) -- in other words, for an application profile
    describing the attributes of a geospatial database as a
    resource (its Title, Date, Coverage, etc) for the purposes
    of resource discovery.

Or, rather, the following:

b)  To comment on how "geospatial attributes" (e.g., things
    related to "location" and "coverage") fit into (i.e.,
    may be represented or not represented) in a Dublin Core
    Application Profile.  This would involve characterizing
    "geospatial" sorts of attributes and commenting on what
    sorts of attributes GIS implementers want or need to put
    into general-purpose descriptions (and hence into the DCAPs
    descriptive of those descriptions).  In other words: "a
    bird's-eye view of the types of data that GIS implementers
    want to put into DCAPs" (as in Makx's note of 3 November).

Either one of the above would seem appropriate as an Appendix
with the given title as long as the text were to make it clear.

As it stands, the text reads a bit like a commentary on the
shortcomings of using Dublin Core-based metadata to describe
geospatial datasets on the basis of a long-obsolete assumption
that values must be represented as "lossy" human-readable
literals ("value strings" in the Abstract Model).  The point of
the DCMI Abstract Model, on which the CEN DCAP work directly
builds, is that more richly structured description can be
accommodated as "related descriptions" or "rich values".
Neither the Abstract Model nor the DCAP model allow you to say
anything about "rich values" -- the same holds for XMLLiterals
in RDF -- they are simply blobs of data ("black boxes") as
far as the model is concerned.  But that is much different
from saying that they have no place in the model.  This point
is actually what we had expected to find in your section...

The text also includes an implied critique to the effect
that RDF is unsuitable for representing geospatial data.
We need to be careful here to distinguish between saying
(exaggerating a bit to make the point):

    It is not easy to model existing geospatial data
    specifications in RDF.

As opposed to saying, more polemically:

    RDF is not suitable for modeling geospatial attributes.

Also, any standards or activities referred to in the text
(i.e., ISO 19115) should be associated with a bibliographic
citation.

The notes below pull together detailed comments from several
sources.  Basically, they reflect the uncertainty about whether
the point was to do "a" or "b" above.

Our suggestion is to say up-front which is intended, then to
tighten up the language in the rest of the text accordingly.

One would expect citations to two or three of the major
"internationally agreed standards" referred to here, but the
sentence could end there.  We do not really want to say that
these standards have "extended the Dublin Core elements"
per se.  Perhaps you want to say something like:

    These standards are now being used in alongside Dublin
    Core to describe geographic data in all its complexity.

Who is going to develop what kind of standard for whom in 2005?
A few words of description and a citation are needed.

This is a start, as it says that geospatial data has to do
with things like "location".  But it does not go very far
in providing a "bird's-eye view of the types of data that
GIS implementers want to put into DCAPs" (from the task as
described on 3 November).

Here, however, you seem to be saying that geospatial data
is about "everything" -- characteristics, relationships to
other resources, etc.

Could one perhaps make a more careful distinction between
"geospatial data" (in the more limited sense of "geospatial
attributes" per se) as opposed to "geospatial data" as
sets of data about things which have, among other things,
"geospatial attributes".  In other words, is this about "a"
or "b" as described above?

This is a key point, but again, it is not really clear what
you are really saying.  Are you simply saying that resources
can have geospatial attributes (location, etc), and that those
geospatial attributes can be used to reveal how the resources
interrelate?  Are you considering temporal attributes to be
"geospatial"?  It's the same issue -- are you talking about
"geospatial attributes" or "geospatial datasets"?

Okay.

This wording is confusing.  Do you mean common set of
metadata "terms" (i.e., elements) or do you really mean
metadata "terminology", which implies something like a
"metadata grammar" or model for talking about metadata.
("Set of terminology" does not work conceptually.)

Do you mean "extension procedures" based on the Dublin Core
model (i.e., dumb-down, application profiles, etc), or do you
mean procedures that somehow "extend" a Dublin Core element?
This is a significant ambiguity because extending an element
semantically is "illegal" in terms of the Dublin Core model...
More precise wording would clarify this.

Is this the same work as referred to above?  A sentence of
description and citation would be needed.

Crosswalks, mappings, and RDF schemas are about showing
the relationship between various vocabularies.  Application
profiles are about showing how different vocabularies are
combined to meet a particular descriptive need.  This sentence
could perhaps be made more precise and specific along the
lines of: "CWA xxxxx provides an application profile which
uses the GI standards X and Y together with Dublin Core
elements for describing resources of type Z" (where "type Z"
is, for example, "geospatial datasets").

I personally think that the data/metadata issue is something
of a red herring...  I take it your point is that neither ISO
19115 nor a DCAP can provide one single, generic method for
describing things in geospatial terms.  And if data cannot
adequately be described generically, it must be described in
application-specific terms.

Not sure what you mean by 'Application schema information'
-- do you something like "intended uses of the information",
or do you mean "information about the XML schemas used by
the application"?

Okay, they don't want to convert their XML schemas into
kludgy string values, fair enough.  The "Dublin Core model"
does not say that they have to...

Dublin Core may have originally been designed following the
card catalog paradigm -- a single resource with properties
associated with text-string values.  However, the "Dublin
Core model" is now that of resources with properties that are
associated with values that may be resources or text strings
-- essentially, the RDF model.  It is counterproductive to
imply otherwise.

Also, the wordings confuse the Dublin Core vocabulary with the
Dublin Core model.  I think you are saying: "GIS requires
richly structured data.  Such data cannot be expressed
in the model of a single resource with properties having
string values."  Not, for example: "Geospatial attributes
cannot be described with the fifteen elements of the Dublin
Core Element Set", which is a bit of a truism.

Assuming you mean the former, and given that the DCMI Abstract
Model does not require literal text-string values, then the
expected point was that structured data must appear in the
DCAP model as a "rich value" or "related description".

It sounds like you are saying that geospatial attributes need
to somehow be translated and presented to non-GIS experts as
text data in order to help them make decisions.  Is that what
you want to say?

In terms of the DCMI Abstract Model [1], such complex
structured data is either a "rich value" or a "related
description".

But if that is the case, is it the DCAP itself -- i.e.,
the document prepared according to the CWA 14855 or the
current draft CWA -- that will require additional parsing,
or is it the metadata based on the application profile that
will require the additional parsing?  An important point.

In other words, is the parsing of those complex values within
the scope of the DCAP per se, or are those complex values
simply passed through in "black boxes".  In other words,
do the black boxes themselves have a place in the model,
and if so, what is that place?

DCMI Point and DCMI Box do not situate a "piece of metadata"
in space; rather, they describe the location of "the resource
that is being referred to".  They do not describe the extent
of a dataset, but rather the coverage of a dataset or the
geographic extent of a resource described in a dataset.
Again, the wordings are not precise.

I'm not sure what you are saying here.  Are you simply
saying that DCMI Point and Box might lead people to conclude
wrongfully that accurate spatial data can be stored in such
simple parsable strings?

Careful...  Saying that RDF model does not lend itself to
implementation is a big claim that would require justification!
Rahter, are you simply saying that geospatial attributes do
not lend themselves easily to modeling in RDF?

This clause does not really say anything but sounds vaguely
provocative.

If this is simply saying that GIS involves complex data that
is difficult to represent in RDF, then that needs to be said
more clearly.

The reason was to provide a clear statement rather than to undertake a
debate and then try to extract a conclusion - which can be difficult from
mail exchanges. In effect to save time. As you would prefer it, I suggest
any further discussion should be on list .....

Forgive me, did I just reply to you and not the list? Wow! Finger
trouble...

I am surprised that you had a phone meeting without my participation
often these things are better resolved in a more open forum than all
against one.

However, I will take what has been said and look forward to the revised
comments that include Thomas' comments.

I certainly received it twice. I think I answered you about being
including in any discussion

In the kindest way please do not presume I don't prefer it we have a
list let us use it.

Many thanks.

We did not have a phone meeting (I wouldn't know how to set
one up), just some 1-on-1 calls.  It started because I did
not understand what the annex text was really about.

You wrote:

    DCSV specifications, DCMI Point and DCMI Box are meant for
    "locating" pieces of metadata, such as dataset extent.

So I wrote:

    DCMI Point and DCMI Box do not situate a "piece of metadata"
    in space; rather, they describe the location of "the resource
    that is being referred to".  They do not describe the extent
    of a dataset, but rather the coverage of a dataset or the
    geographic extent of a resource described in a dataset.
    Again, the wordings are not precise.

But that wasn't quite precise enough, so I corrected:

    Or rather: they describe the location that the resource being
    referred to is "about"...

That was yesterday.  Today we are speaking with the author.

There is no comment log, and Rachel has posted the comments.

Right, I should state clearer. I assumed, as you felt it better for me,
that you came up with comments collectively before speaking with me I
would get an updated comment sheet sent me please before I comment back.
Unless, of course, your added comment was not relevant? In addition, I
will write up my comments to your comments bearing in mind I may not be
able to do it by the deadline imposed. Then you can discuss it. Ergo
optimizing your time.

Interesting that we have not been paid for the interim payment and will
not get it this year and yet you feel a need to give me a week on this?
Ho hum...

Sorry your emails are crossing my friend.

I repeat for clarity:

1 I may not be able to meet Dec 3rd imposed deadline.
2 I will work on what the "team-1" sent out to me.
3 I will write a report for you all and return it to you as soon as
possible.

This clearly meets the requirements and satisfies us all.

Thanks.

I was just responding to something I had written two hours
before which, on re-reading online, seemed insufficiently

Martin, I am not CEN and do not quite understand why this is
starting to sound like an argument.  In good faith, I tried
to write careful comments.  Really no need to wait a week to
start discussing if you'd prefer.

Thomas I am pleased with you tone. I fail to see why I had to wait a
week though before I saw comments that still were not complete. What was
wrong with speaking with me? I had more time last week now I am failing
a deadline you are imposing because I did not know your comments
earlier. Martin

Martin,

I just started writing my comments last night and finished this
morning.  My apologies if there was any misunderstanding...

Thomas

As ever I always respect your thoughts and comments. For clarification I
was referring to the original email from you all not you in particular.
The email read:

Martin, I am forwarding our combined comments on Annex E which I hope
you will find helpful. The overall message is a request for
clarification.

MF: Now I read this as you have all had a meeting and decided on a
combined set of comments. Sorry did not understand why they could not
have been sent to the list. However in return, I am expected to openly
discuss with the team.

As you will see there is quite a lot of detailed comment to highlight
where and why that clarification is required.

I hope you will be able to do some re-working of the annex, keeping in
mind that as an annex it can be kept reasonably short.

MF: This makes an assumption that am I understand the comments and b, I
agree with them. Let alone if I think it should be kept short. I do
consider it a straight jacket approach to what the rest of the team
believe in.

I would like to set a deadline of Dec 3 if that is feasible for you? we
are planning to circulate the final version before the Christmas break.

MF: We, that's a you not a me as I see no reason to send anything out if
CEN are not paying.

Just for clarification.

Dear all,

I was surprised to read the cascade of messages that followed
Rachel's message with comments on Martin's Annex E on Friday.

From my perspective, I do not think anything was wrong with the
procedure, but I accept that people can have different opinions on
that. However, the important thing is to discuss and resolve the
comments. We need to get this done fairly soon given the deadlines
we are working against.

On the other point, concerning the apparent dispute that Martin has
with CEN over their non-payment of his invoice, we need to urgently
clarify the situation.

It appears, Martin, from what you wrote at the end of your message
below, that you are considering withholding further contributions to
Work Item 4 until you receive payment from CEN.

If this is indeed the case, we will have to notify CEN immediately
of this situation as we cannot resolve this within the team. It
would be helpful if Martin notified CEN formally of his position.

As agreed in the September MMI meeting, we have to submit the final
CWA at least two weeks in advance of the meeting, which gives us a
29 December deadline. It makes sense to try and get this done before
Christmas as Rachel suggests. In the worst case, if Martin cannot
resolve his dispute with CEN, we may have to deliver the final CWA
without Annex E.

Makx.

OK. Can you let me know what the situation is concerning your
dispute with CEN? Will this have consequences for the work in work
item 4?

Thank you again for such a quick response.

I have no dispute with CEN. I have not said I will not do the work, but
I may not be able to meet the deadline of Friday.

Good to know there is no issue there.

Fair enough. I think it would be good if Rachel (for CWA1) and Tom
(for CWA2) could let the group know what their schedules are for
the finalisation of the two CWAs, so we can agree on an overall
timetable for finalisation and submission before the Christmas
break.

Just as a reminder, WP4/CWA1 consists of the following tasks:

Task 4.1 Incorporate comments from September meeting and feedback
         from international contacts
Task 4.2 Incorporate section on interoperability with IEEE/LOM
         approach
Task 4.3 Incorporate comment on issues arising from a GIS
         perspective as an annex
Task 4.4 Present to DCMI for review. Present to IEEE LTSC for
         information and review
Task 4.5 Finalise and distribute CWA

Likewise, WP4/CWA2 consists of the following tasks:

Task 4.1 Incorporate comments from September 2004 meeting and
         feedback from international contacts
Task 4.2 Present draft guidelines for review on relevant DCMI
         mailing lists
Task 4.3 Finalise and distribute CWA

Makx.

I am not aware of any comments? is anyone else aware of comments? Note:
Pete is not in the office to-day.

Done.

Now under discussion

I think we should take care on our approach to this circulation. I am
thinkuing that we would circulate this CWA to DC Architecture WG and DC
Usage Board lists; and to the IEEE list previously recommended by Erik.

I don't think we should raise expectation that we can incorporate major
re-writes resulting from comments from  larger DCMI and IEEE LTSC
communities at this stage. I think we need to position these
'circulations' as dissemination of work done so far and opportunity to
encourage longer term discussion and debate. Within the DC community we
can suggest the document might be discussed on the WG list and be
submitted to next Usage Board meeting?

Assuming that approach is agreed in this group then I think we could
circulate to the mailing lists on 6 December, requesting any *factual*
corrections by 15 December, and suggesting discussion would be taken into
account in longer term plans of the MMI-DC WG...


> Task 4.5 Finalise and distribute CWA
>

Distribute 20 December

(Note I am on leave from 22 December to 5 January. Also I will be having
daily hospital treatment in January so unfortunately will not be able to
attend the January CEN meeting. I would like to discuss with Makx and
Tom whether they would be able to cover the CWA1 slot at the meeting for
me..??)

The latest copy is at

ftp://ftp.cenorm.be/public/ws-mmi-dc/mmidc116.htm

Having searched for this I found the following suggested revision s for
the CWA on Pete's presentation in September:

<quote>
Possibly add commentary on use of the model, alternatively additional use
case?
Combine definitions in 2.1 and 6.1 ?
</quote>

I think combining the definitions seems sensible. I will discuss
additional use case with Pete.
