			<H4>Proposal for DC Rights Working Group<br>
			Date: 1 October 1999<br>
			From: Trisha Davis, Associate Professor, Head, <br>Serials & Electronic Resources Dept Ohio State University Libraries</H4>
<P>Libraries, educational systems, and scholars are at a crisis point in dealing with intellectual property rights issues.  As a colleague recently wrote in a letter to Congress:</P>
<P>Data and information are the foundation of all research and education activities.  Members of the library and education communities rely on access to information in all aspects of teaching and research including the preservation of our cultural and scientific heritage. Such access is integral to the success of the U.S. educational system and to our leadership in the global economy.</P>
<P>As the scholarly communication chain has evolved into the digital age, libraries' ability to preserve Fair Use rights is deteriorating. Publishers' practice of contractual licensing in lieu of traditional 'first sale', has forced libraries restrict access, monitor use, and limit valuable education and research activities simply because the source materials are in digital format.</P>
<P>The recent DMCA and it's ongoing development does include an exemption for education and research activities. Yet even with the recent hearings and suggested changes from the Copyright Office, the legislation remains far too narrow to provide rights in the digital environment equivalent to those in print.</P>
<P>Scholars are caught in both ends of the battle.  As researchers in a digital world, they are finding it too costly to access information and acquire the needed rights to do their research. As authors they wish to retain their own intellectual property rights and not be forced to surrender the control of all use rights, both print and electronic, to their publisher. </P>
<P>DC and other metadata initiatives can help greatly to design a response to these needs.  By development of a series of rights options available directly to individuals, outside the commercial environment, costs of rights management can be significantly reduced. True scholarship demands the authenticity confirmation that DC affords and the ability to identify rights holders for the purpose of obtaining legal permission to use the material. The DC Rights field definition appears to identify the rights holder simply, yet adequately. This information is helpful, but does not go far enough. Both as an author and an end user, I would like a set of rights options that I can select from. This could be as simple as lifting standard use statements from existing licenses. Within the scholarly world, there is much information that could/would be made available on the Internet by individuals if they had such a control mechanism in place.</P>
<P>I would hope that this could be considered by your DC Rights working group and I'd be happy to work with anyone on setting up some examples for discussion.
