 <H1>More about metadata</H1> 
 <P><UL>
<LI><H2>Metadata is data that describes and qualifies other data. Typical examples of metdata is important properties of the data (e.g. the name of the creator, and the year of publication), data that is used to locate the data (e.g. the Dewey-code for a library book, and the time and channel for a television program), and data that is helpful when searching for data (e.g. a free-text description or a summary of the data, or a list of searchable subject keywords appropriate for the data).

<LI><H2>There is currently a lot of interest in using metadata to improve the quality of Interner resource discovery. Most of this activity is rooted in the metadata activity carried by the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Technology and Society Domain, and the Dublin Core Workshop (DC) series. W3C’s work has resulted in  the defintion of a syntax for expressing metadata which is simple to process by machine, named the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is an application of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). The DC activity has defined a core element set of bibliographic categories that is intended to be used to describe electronic resources.</H2>
