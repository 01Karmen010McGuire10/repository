<LI><H2>The primary source for metadata is resource owner (e.g. the creator or publisher) to create metadata describing own resources. The same scheme would be used by individuals (e.g. individual shareware programmers), corporations (e.g. software companies) and organizations (such as a user group aligned with some development platform) to bind metadata to resources. It should be possible for other entities than the creator or publisher to create metadata files. One possible scenario is that a cooperative body such as the (fictional) Gazonk User Group (GUG) organizes an effort to document through metadata files all the resources on the web of value to the Gazonk using community. Gazonk hackers searching the web can then specify to the search engine that they are only interested in hits associated with metadata files bearing the GUG signature.
