			<H4>Announcement:<br>
				Dublin Core Working Group on Authorities</H4>
<p>The objectives of this Working Group are to discuss the advantages and possibilities of a special Dublin Core metadata set for persons, to settle a draft for a standard set and to prepare a proposal for application conventions.<br>
The background of this intention is the view on persons and organisations not only to have the creator role in documents but to be involved in other considerable roles, too, both concerning documents and other objects. In this view persons should  be represented as separate objects with distinct relations to documents and other objects. Both the librarian data model of  the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records and the metadata model of the INDECs project are based on this view. We think there is good reason for it as  the identification and authentification of persons and corporate bodies gain more and more importance in our networked environment,  not only for the management of rights. Though there is a lot of discussion in the Dublin Core community and in various other initiatives and projects a metadata description of persons as objects of the real world is still lacking and should be developed. This could contribute to provide interoperability between the libraries' authority files and the personal metadata created and needed by authors, publishers, rights managers etc..<br>
If you are part of a project dealing with persons or if you are interested in the description of persons, corporate bodies and objects you should join this working group in the working group meeting at the DC 7 workshop. </P>
<P>The agenda for the working group on persons and authorities:<br>
<OL>
<LI>Overview of  projects and initiatives 
<LI>Discussion of problems and difficulties Drafting of necessary attributes for persons (and corporate bodies)
<LI>Drafting of Relations to other documents and objects
<LI>First draft of a Dublin Core metadata set
<LI>Presentation and discussion in the plenary session 
Setting up an agenda for outstanding problems and the further work (further discussion on a new discussion list?)
</OL>
</P>
<P>This working group surely has a strong connection to other Dublin Core working groups, especially to the data model group, the schema group and the DC-agents group.</P>
