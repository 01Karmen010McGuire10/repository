			<H4>Registration Procedure for the 7th Dublin Core Workshop</H4>
			<P>This workshop, like the previous in the Dublin Core Workshop Series, will take place on an invitational basis. This means that it is not as open to the general public as a regular educational workshops; instead it requires certain procedures for nomination, invitation and registration. </P>
			<P>Participants are expected to bear expertise and experience with resource description and/or policies and planning for resource description systems and methodologies. Nominations from any field are welcome, including libraries, museum informatics, publishing, commerce, network specialists, archives, and specific content domains.</P>
			<H4>Step 1: Call for Nominations</H4>
			<P>The DC directorate sends out a formal call for nominations to the DC-general mailing list. This message describes the general goal of the workshop, nominating and registrating procedures, who should participate and deadlines.

			</UL>
			<H4>Step 2: Nominations / Expression of Interest (deadline: August 1)</H4>
			<P>Prospective workshop participants must then react in the form of an expression of their interest. This can be done by self nominations or by another party. This expression of interest should include the nominee's name, address (including e-mail), affiliation and relation to the DC initiative. For participants of former DC workshops, it is enough to drop a short note; others should be more specific in describing their area of expertise, their experience with implementations, their planning or policy responsibilities for metadata implementation, or their representation of a stakeholder community.</P>
			<H4>Step 3: Invitations Issued (September 1)</H4>
			<P>On the basis of the incoming nominations, a certain selection will be made (particularly if the target of some 100 participants will be exceeded). The selected prospective workshop participants will be informed and asked by e-mail to register for the workshop.</P>
			<H4>Step 4: Publishing the Preliminary Workshop Agenda (September 1)</H4>
			<P>At the same time the preliminary workshop agenda will be published on the workshop web-site. As with other workshops, this will only be very tentative. Everybody needs to be aware that the actual agenda will be fixed much closer to the workshop (approximately two weeks prior).<BR><I>Still under development</I></P>
			<H4>Step 5: Workshop Registration (deadline: October 1)</H4>
			<P>During the month of September, the actual registration will be open. For that purpose, the respective web pages and internet registration forms will be activated. Registration is mandatory and closes on October 1. Registration fee is <nobr>240 EURO</nobr>, payable at the time of registration.
