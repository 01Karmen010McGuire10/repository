			<H4>DC-Standards REPORT and AGENDA for meeting at DC-7<br>From: Priscilla Caplan and Leif Andresen</H4>
<H5>Report</H5>

<P>The DC-Standards Working Group started the work early 1999 with deciding the aims of the group:</P>
<P>Working Group Charter:<br>
The group shall be a forum for individuals involved in various standardization efforts to keep in touch with each other and to monitor the progress of the Dublin Core as it makes its way through the different standards processes. This group is specifically concerned with issues related to the formalisation of Dublin Core, and its acceptance within standards initiatives such as CEN, ISO, and NISO.
</P>
<P>According to this charter, the deliverables aren't reports and papers but agreements about problems according to the standardization process in different areas.
</P>
<P>We decide spring 1999 to use DC 1.1 as basis for standardization process and wait for it.
</P>
<P>We now discuss when and how to include qualifiers in the standardization processes.</P>
<P>The DC-Standards Working Group isn't the most active one. But standardization takes time and the chairs of the WG recommend that DC-Standards continue after DC-7.
</P><H5>Agenda</H5>
<P>Tuesday, October 26 - 8:30 - 9:00 3rd Working Group Session (partly)</P>
