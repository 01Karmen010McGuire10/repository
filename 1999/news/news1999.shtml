<p><b><a name="19990927"></a>1999-09-27: Open eBook announces final version of 
their new 1.0 specification</b></p>
<p>One element of the <a href="http://www.openebook.org/">Open eBook Initiative</a> 
is a <a href="http://www.openebook.org/specification.htm">specification</a> for 
eBook file and format structure based on HTML and XML. It is important to note 
that Dublin Core is the metadata standard being promoted in the specification. 
The goal of the specification is to quickly create a critical mass of compelling 
content. A publisher will be able to format a title once according to the specification 
and the content will be compatible with a wide variety of reading devices.</p>

<p><a name="cimi"></a><b>1999-08-18: CIMI Announces the release of the <i>Guide 
to Best Practice: Dublin Core</i></b></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cimi.org/documents/meta_bestprac_final_ann.html">Guide 
to Best Practice: Dublin Core</a> addresses Dublin Core 1.0 as documented in RFC 
2413 and is an immportant result of CIMI's Dublin Core Testbed, an on-going effort 
to explore the usability, simplicity, and technical feasibility of Dublin Core 
for museum information. Recommendations expressed in the Guide are based on the 
experiences of the Testbed participants and are designed to assist the reader 
with several tasks, including: how the Dublin Core standard can be applied to 
museum information; mapping existing data elements sets to the Dublin Core element 
set; the creation of Dublin Core records via manual or automated tools; implementing 
institutional policies regarding information access and retrieval. It is intended 
to be used by information managers, content experts and anyone in the museum community 
involved with creating and disseminating museum information</p>
<p>In addition, the Guide mill be used in a series of workshops designed for museum 
professionals. The first two of these workshops will take place this fall - see 
the <a href="http://www.archimuse.com/ichim99/ichim99.html">ICHIM99</a> and <a href="http://www.mcn.edu/MCN99/">MCN99</a> conference programs for further details. The remainder of the workshops will run 
through Spring 2000.</p>
