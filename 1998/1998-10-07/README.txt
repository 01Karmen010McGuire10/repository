2008-06-27 Notes from Tom Baker

While cleaning out old files for the Web migration to Singapore,
I found this tar file which, as near as I can tell, is a snapshot
of a purl.org Dublin Core site as of late 1998.

On 2008-06-27 the following purl.org URIs resolved as follows:

    http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements -> http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/
    http://purl.org/metadata/ -> http://purl.oclc.org/metadata/dublin_core/
    http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core/ -> http://purl.oclc.org/dc/
    http://purl.oclc.org/dc/ -> http://dublincore.org/
