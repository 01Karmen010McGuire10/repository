<P>
See  the Dublin Core <A HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">
home page </A> for further information about the workshops, reports,
working group papers, projects, and new developments concerning the
Dublin Core metadata element set. </P>

<P>
This document is the reference description of the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set, as elaborated in Dublin Core Metadata Workshops and related working
groups (See the <A HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">
home page </A> for further details).</p>

<P>
The current list of elements and their general definitions were finalized
in December, 1996.  The elements and their names
are not expected to change substantively from this list, though the
application of some of them are currently experimental and subject to
interpretation.  Further, it is expected that practice will evolve to
include sub-elements qualifiers for certain of the elements.  Such changes
will be reflected here as they evolve.</p>

<P>
Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common
semantic understanding of the element.  In addition, a formal,
single-word label is specified to make syntactic specification of
elements simpler in encoding schemes.</p>
<P>

<H2>Element Descriptions</H2>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME = "title"><H3>Title</H3></A> Label: TITLE <BR>
    <P>

    The name given to the resource by the CREATOR or PUBLISHER. </P>

<LI><A NAME = "creator"><H3>Author or Creator</H3> Label: CREATOR <BR>
     <P>
     The person(s) or organization(s) primarily responsible for the
     intellectual content of the resource.  For example, authors in the
     case of written documents, artists, photographers, or illustrators
     in the case of visual resources.</P>

<LI><A NAME = "subject"><H3>Subject and Keywords</H3></A> Label: SUBJECT <BR>
     <P>
     The topic of the resource, or keywords or phrases that describe
     the subject or content of the resource.  The intent of the
     specification of this element is to promote the use of controlled
     vocabularies and keywords.  This element might well include
     scheme-qualified classification data (for example, Library of
     Congress Classification Numbers or Dewey Decimal numbers) or
     scheme-qualified controlled vocabularies (such as MEdical Subject
     Headings or Art and Architecture Thesaurus descriptors) as well.</P>
    
<LI><A NAME = "description"><H3>Description</H3></A> Label: DESCRIPTION <BR>
    <P>
     A textual description of the content of the resource, including
     abstracts in the case of document-like objects or content
     descriptions in the case of visual resources.  Future metadata
     collections might well include computational content description
     (spectral analysis of a visual resource, for example) that may not
     be embeddable in current network systems.  In such a case this
     field might contain a link to such a description rather than the
     description itself.</P>
    
<LI><A NAME = "publisher"> <H3>Publisher</H3></A> Label: PUBLISHER <BR>
    <P>
     The entity responsible for making the resource available in its
     present form, such as a publisher, a university department, or a
     corporate entity.   The intent of specifying this field is to
     identify the entity that provides access to the resource. </P>
     
<LI><A NAME = "contributors"> <H3>Other Contributors</H3></A> Label: CONTRIBUTORS <BR>
     <P>
     Person(s) or organization(s) in addition to those specified in the
     CREATOR element who have made significant intellectual
     contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary
     to the individuals or entities specifed in the CREATOR element
     (for example, editors, transcribers, illustrators, and
     convenors).</P>



<LI><A NAME = "date"> <H3>Date</H3> </A> 	Label: DATE <BR>
     <P>
     The date the resource was made available in its present form.  The
     recommended best practice is an 8 digit number in the form
     YYYYMMDD as defined by ANSI X3.30-1985. In this scheme, the date
     element for the day this is written would be 19961203, or December
     3, 1996.  Many other schema are possible, but if used, they should
     be identified in an unambiguous manner.</P>
   
<LI><A NAME = "type"><H3>Resource Type</H3> </A> Label: TYPE <BR>
     <P>
     The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working
     paper, preprint, technical report, essay, dictionary.  It is expected that
     RESOURCE TYPE will be chosen from an enumerated list of types. A
     preliminary set of such types can be found at the following URL:<BR>
     
     http://www.roads.lut.ac.uk/Metadata/DC-ObjectTypes.html</P>

<LI><A NAME = "format"><H3>Format</H3> </A> Label: FORMAT <BR>
     <P>
     The data representation of the resource, such as text/html, ASCII,
     Postscript file,  executable application, or JPEG image.  The
     intent of specifying this element is to provide information
     necessary to allow people or machines to make decisions about the
     usability of the encoded data (what hardware and software might be
     required to display or execute it, for example).  As with RESOURCE TYPE,
     FORMAT will be assigned from enumerated lists such as registered
     Internet Media Types (MIME types).  In principal, formats can include
     physical media such as books, serials, or other non-electronic media.  </p>
 
<LI><A NAME = "identifier"><H3>Resource Identifier</H3> </A> Label: IDENTIFIER <BR>
     <P>
     String or number used to uniquely identify the resource.  Examples
     for networked resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other
     globally-unique identifiers,such as International Standard
     Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names would also be candidates for 
     this element.</P>

<LI><A NAME = "source"><H3>Source</H3> </A>	Label: SOURCE <BR>
     <P>
     The work, either print or electronic, from which this resource is
     derived, if applicable. For example, an html encoding of a
     Shakespearean sonnet might identify the paper version of the
     sonnet from which the electronic version was transcribed.</p>

<LI><A NAME = "language"><H3>Language</H3> </A>	Label: LANGUAGE <BR>
     <P>
     Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource.  Where practical,
     the content of this field should coincide with the Z39.53 three character
     codes for written languages. </P>
     <P>
     See: http://www.sil.org/sgml/nisoLang3-1994.html </P>

<LI><A NAME = "relation"><H3>Relation</H3> 	Label: RELATION <BR>
     <P>
     Relationship to other resources.  The intent of specifying this
     element is to provide a means to express relationships among
     resources that have formal relationships to others, but exist as
     discrete resources themselves.  For example, images in a
     document,  chapters in a book, or items in a collection.  A formal
     specification of RELATION is currently under development.  Users
     and developers should understand that use of this element should
     be currently considered experimental.</p>

<LI><A NAME = "coverage"> <H3>Coverage</H3> </A> Label: COVERAGE <BR>
     <P>
     The spatial locations and temporal durations characteristic of the
     resource.    Formal specification of COVERAGE is currently under
     development. Users and developers should understand that use of
     this element should be currently considered experimental.</P>
      
<LI><A NAME = "rights"> <H3>Rights Management</H3> </A> Label: RIGHTS
     <P>
     The content of this element is intended to be a link (a URL or
     other suitable URI as appropriate) to a copyright notice, a
     rights-management statement, or perhaps a server that would
     provide such information in a dynamic way.  The intent of
     specifying this field is to allow providers a means to associate
     terms and conditions or copyright statements with a resource or
     collection of resources.   No assumptions should be made by users
     if such a field is empty or not present.</P>
