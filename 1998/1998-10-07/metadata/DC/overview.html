    <h3>Metadata for Electronic Resources</h3>

    <p>The Dublin Core is a 15-element metadata element set intended to facilitate discovery
      of electronic resources. Originally conceived for author-generated description of Web
      resources, it has also attracted the attention of formal resource description communities
      such as museums and libraries. </p>

    <p>The Dublin Core Workshop Series has gathered experts from the library world, the
      networking and digital library research communities, and a variety of content specialties
      in a series of focussed, invitational workshops. The building of an interdisciplinary,
      international consensus around a core element set is the central feature of the three-year
      evolution of the Dublin Core. The progress represents the emergent wisdom and collective
      experience of many stakeholders in the resource description arena. An open mailing list
      supports ongoing work. </p>

    <p>The characteristics of the Dublin Core that distinguish it as a prominent candidate for
      description of electronic resources fall into several categories. </p>

    <h4>Simplicity</h4>

    <p>The Dublin Core is intended to be usable by non-catalogers as well as by those with
      experience with formal resource description models. </p>

    <p>Most of the 15 elements have a commonly understood semantics that represents what might
      be described as roughly equivalent to a catalog card for electronic resources. </p>

    <h4>Semantic Interoperability</h4>

    <p>In the Internet Commons, disparate description models interfere with the ability to
      search across discipline boundaries. Promoting a commonly understood set of descriptors
      that helps to unify other data content standards increases the possibility of semantic
      interoperability across disciplines. The Dublin Core is the leading candidate as a <em>lingua
	franca</em> for resource discovery on the Internet. </p>

    <h4>International Consensus</h4>

    <p>Recognition of the international scope of resource discovery on the Web is critical to
      the development of effective discovery infrastructure. The Dublin Core has benefited from
      active participation and promotion in the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, Denmark,
      Norway, Finland, Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, Canada, and the United States. </p>

    <h4>Flexibility</h4>

    <p>Although initially motivated by the need for author-generated resource description, the
      Dublin Core includes sufficient flexibility to encode the additional structure and more
      elaborate semantics appropriate to more formal resource description applications. </p>

    <h3>Metadata Modularity on the Web</h3>

    <p>The wide diversity of metadata needs on the Web requires an environment that supports
      the coexistence of many independently developed and maintained metadata packages. The
      Dublin Core is targeted specifically towards resource discovery, but other, functionally
      distinct packages will evolve (for example, terms and conditions, archival management,
      administrative metadata, and many others). </p>

    <p>Recognition of the desirability of this sort of modularity has guided the evolution of
      the Dublin Core since the Warwick Workshop, and has been formalized as the Warwick
      Framework. The concepts articulated in this work have informed the ongoing development of
      a metadata architecture for the Web as well. </p>

    <h4>A Metadata Architecture for the Web</h4>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is the primary
      standards forum for the Web, and has recently begun to focus on implementing an
      architecture for metadata for the Web. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Metadata/RDF">Resource
	Description Framework</a>, or RDF, is evolving to support the many different metadata
      needs of vendors and information providers. Representatives of the Dublin Core effort are
      actively involved in the development of this architecture, bringing the digital library
      perspective to bear on this important component of the Web infrastructure. </p>
