<h3>Relations Working Group</h3>

<P>This report is a record of the efforts of the Relations working
group constituted following the Helsinki Metadata Workshop (DC-5) of
October, 1997. The recommendations are provisional and can be expected
to evolve in the light of further implementation experience.</P>

<P>David Bearman, Chair</P>

<P> I. It is important to indicate the relation between one
information resource and another in metadata for discovery. Because
each information resource may have its own metadata set, these
relations need to be explicit.</P>

<P>II. Relations are indicated in Dublin Core metadata by the Relation
element. Relation has two sub-elements: Relation.Identifier and
Relation.Type.</P>

<P>III. The value assigned to Relation.Identifier identifies the
metadata of the related resource or, where this is not possible, the
related resource itself. For more information on the use of this
sub-element, see the description of the Identifier element.</P>

<P>IV. The value assigned to Relation.Type describes the nature of the
relationship between the current resource and the resource identified
by Relation.Identifier. The value of this sub-element is selected from
a list of possible values. The DC community has constructed such a
list; this is described below. Other organisations may construct their
own lists, at the cost of interoperability. In due course, scheme
identification will be used to indicate which list of values, and
associated meanings, is being invoked.</P>

<P>V. The DC list of values for the Relation.Type sub-element follows.</P>

<P>Six pairs of relations are defined at this time.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>a) Part/Whole relations are those in which one resource is a physical or logical part of another. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>IsPartOf</P>
<P>HasPart</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>b) Version relations are those in which one resource is an historical state or edition of another resource by the same creator. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>IsVersionOf</P>
<P>HasVersion</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>c) Format transformation relations are those in which one resource
has been derived from another by a reproduction or reformatting
technology which is not fundamentally an interpretation but is
intended to be a representation. The corresponding values of
Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>IsFormatOf</P>
<P>HasFormat</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>d) Reference relations are those in which the author of one resource cites, acknowledges, disputes or otherwise refers to another resource. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>References</P>
<P>IsReferencedBy</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>e) Creative relations are those in which one resource is a
performance, production, derivation, translation, adaptation or
interpretation of another resource. The corresponding values of
Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>IsBasedOn</P>
<P>IsBasisFor</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>f) Dependency relations are those in which one resource requires
another resource for its functioning, delivery, or content and cannot
be used without the related resource being present. The corresponding
values of Relation.Type are:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Requires</P>
<P>IsRequiredBy</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P> </P>

<P>VI. Specialized communities will need to extend the references
relations to express specific types of references or authorial
claims.</P>

<P>VII. When the Relation element is used in unqualified Dublin Core
metadata, the values of the two sub-elements may be placed directly
within the Relation element. If this is done, recommended best
practice is to place first the value of the Relation.Type sub-element
and second the value of the Relation.Identifier sub-element,
separating the two with a space, eg:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>IsBasedOn http://a.b.c/foo.bar</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>
