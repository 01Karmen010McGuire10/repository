    <h2>The Dublin Core: Organization</h2>
    <h3>May 21, 1998</h3>


    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core has become an important part of the emerging
    infrastructure of the Internet.  Many communities are eager to
    adopt a common core of semantics for resource description, and the
    Dublin Core has attracted broad ranging international and
    interdisciplinary support for this purpose.</P>

    <P>To date, the effort has succeeded on the force of the energy
    and personalities of the cadre of individuals who have invested
    their intellect and enthusiasm.  Continued progress will require
    more of the same.  In addition, expanding acceptance of the Dublin
    Core will require organizational stability and a formal process
    for refinement and change.</P>

    <P>This proposal outlines formal procedures to support the
    evolution of the Dublin Core.  These procedures are, for the most
    part, borrowed from other standards communities.  Every effort
    will be made to keep them light-weight and efficient, and always
    with an eye on the goal of nurturing the international consensus
    that has become the most valuable asset of the Dublin Core
    Initiative.</P>

    <h3>The Dublin Core Directorate</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core initiative has from its beginning been an
    international consensus-building activity. The Dublin Core
    Directorate will, in consultation with advisory committees, render
    judgements as to the character of the consensus and the state of
    the Dublin Core.  The Directorate coordinates Dublin Core
    workshops, working group activities, and dissemination of
    information about the Dublin Core initiative via the Web site and
    other publications. The Dublin Core Directorate is currently
    hosted by the OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.</P>

    <h3>The Dublin Core Policy Advisory Committee</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core Policy Advisory Committee (DC-PAC) serves as a
    two-way conduit to support communication with stakeholder
    communities and international policy agencies.  The DC-PAC will,
    as well, provide to the Dublin Core community guidance concerning
    the strategic issues central to the development of the Dublin Core
    as an international standard for resource discovery.</P>

    <P>The DC-PAC has been constituted from policy leaders from
    various disciplines who have made substantive contributions to the
    emergence of the Dublin Core and who represent the geographic
    diversity critical to its world-wide adoption.</P>

    <h3>The Dublin Core Technical Advisory Committee</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core Technical Advisory Committee (DC-TAC) serves as
    a rapid-response advisory committee to help focus the
    issue-resolution process and reflect the concerns of the larger
    community in the development technical and semantic
    characteristics of the Dublin Core.  The Technical Advisory
    Committee is comprised of the Chairs and Co-chairs of the working
    groups, and additional members who provide valuable technical
    advice or liaison with other communities.</P>

    <h3>Working Groups</h3>

    <P>Working groups are formed and dissolved as necessitated by the
    work at hand and the availability of expertise to accomplish such
    work.  Working groups will be comprised of volunteers with the
    interest, expertise, and time to contribute to the solution of
    problems.</P>

    <P>Chairs and Co-chairs of working groups are appointed by the
    Directorate in consultation with working group members and
    advisory committees.  These individuals are responsible for
    organizing the efforts of the respective working groups, and
    producing deliverables that result from working group activities.
    In addition, these individuals will serve in an advisory capacity
    on the Technical Advisory Committee.</P>

    <h3>The Dublin Core Web Site</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core Web site be the formal repository for
    information about the workshop series, working group activities,
    standards activities, and related information.  As the major
    public entry point to the Dublin Core, the Web site will include
    areas such as:
    <UL>
      <LI>Workshop Web sites and documents</LI>
      <LI>Working Group issue lists and related documents</LI>
      <LI>Bibliography of Dublin Core publications</LI>
      <LI>Links to implementation projects</LI>
      <LI>Standards documents</LI>
      <LI>Working papers</LI>
      <LI>Frequently Asked Questions</LI>
    </UL>

    <h3>The Meta2 Mailing List</h3>

    <P>The Meta2 mailing list has served as the central discussion
    forum for Dublin Core issues since the second Dublin Core
    workshop.  The list will continue to be the primary venue for
    broad community discussion of Dublin Core recommendations and
    announcements of planned DC events.</P>
