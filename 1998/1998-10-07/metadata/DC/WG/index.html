    <h1>The Dublin Core: Working Groups</h1>

    <P>Dublin Core working groups are organized around specific
    problem domains.  Working groups are formed and dissolved as
    dictated by the work at hand and the availibility of expertise to
    accomplish such work.

    <P>Working groups have chairs and co-chairs who also serve as
    members of the Dublin Core Technical Advisory Committee.
    Participation is open to interested members of the community with
    the time and expertise relevant to the domain of the group.
    Individual interested in joining a working group may do so by
    sending an email message indicating their interest and brackground
    to the chair of the working group.

    <P> The following working groups have been identified by the Dublin Core Initiative:

      <UL>
	<LI><A HREF="relation/">Relation</A>
	<LI><A HREF="datamodel/">Data Model</A>
	<LI><A HREF="internationalization/">Internationalization</A>
	<LI><A HREF="userguide/">User Guide</A>
	<LI><A HREF="formatstypes/">Formats&nbsp;and&nbsp;Types</A>
    </UL>

    <P>Working groups conduct business via email, at Dublin Core
    Workshops, and at formal working group meetings. Each Working
    Group will post its intermediate results (called <B>Draft
    Documents</B> on the appropriate Working Group Web space. Working
    drafts will be labeled as such. These documents are <B>DRAFT</B>
    and have not been endorsed the the Dublin Core Community.
