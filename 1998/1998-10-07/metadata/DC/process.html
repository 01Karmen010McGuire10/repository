  <A name="Background">Chapter 1 - W3C Background</A>
</H2>
<H3>
  <A name="W3CDefinition">1.1 What is W3C?</A>
</H3>
<P>
Founded in 1994 to develop common protocols for the evolution of the World
Wide Web, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international association
of industrial and service companies, research laboratories, educational
institutions and organizations of all sizes. All of these organizations share
a compelling interest in the long term evolution and stability of the World
Wide Web (Web).
<P>
W3C is a non-profit organization funded  partly by commercial members.
Its activities remain vendor neutral, however. W3C also receives the support
of governments who consider the Web the platform of choice for a global
information infrastructure.
<P>
W3C was originally established in collaboration with CERN, birthplace of
the Web, with support from DARPA and the European Commission.
<H3>
  <A name="Mission">1.2 What is W3C's Mission?</A>
</H3>
<P>
W3C's mission is to lead the evolution of the Web -- the universe of information
accessible through networked computers.
<P>
W3C's long term goals are:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <EM>Superior Web Technology.</EM> By promoting interoperability and encouraging
    an open forum for discussion, W3C commits to leading the technical evolution
    of the Web. W3C must ensure that the Web remains a robust, scalable, and
    adaptive infrastructure.
  <LI>
    <EM>Universal Web Accessibility.</EM> W3C strives to make the Web accessible
    to as many users as possible and to promote technologies that take into account
    the vast differences in culture, education, ability, material resources,
    and physical limitations of users on all continents.
  <LI>
    <EM>Responsible Web Application.</EM> However vast the Web becomes, it remains
    essentially a medium for human communication. As such, the Web's impact on
    society cannot be dissociated from decisions that guide its development.
    W3C must guide the Web's development with careful consideration for the novel
    legal, commercial, and social issues raised by this technology.
</UL>
<H3>
  <A name="Consensus">1.3 W3C's consensus policy</A>
</H3>
<P>
Integral to the W3C process is the notion of <EM>consensus</EM>. The W3C
process requires those who are considering an issue to address all participants'
views and objections and strive to resolve them. Consensus is established
when substantial agreement has been reached by the participants. Substantial
agreement means more than a simple majority, but not necessarily unanimity.
In some circumstances, consensus is achieved when the minority no longer
wishes to articulate its objections. When disagreement is strong, the opinions
of the minority should be recorded alongside those of the majority.
<P>
Groups strive to reach consensus in order to provide a single solution acceptable
to the market at large. If a group makes a decision that causes the market
to fragment -- despite consensus by those participating in the decision --
the decision does not reflect a single market and therefore the group has
failed to reach true consensus.
<H3>
  <A name="dissemination">1.4 W3C's dissemination policy</A>
</H3>
<P>
All W3C final results are made available free of charge to the general public.
This policy comes from the core goal of W3C to keep the Web as one and is
part of the membership agreement.
<P>
Moreover, to ensure that its results are acceptable to the general public
and therefore get implemented in products and services, W3C may call for
public comments about intermediate documents.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<H2>
  <A name="Organization">Chapter 2 - W3C Organization</A>
</H2>
<P>
<EM>Unless otherwise stated, all announcements, replies, confirmations,
notifications, votes, minutes, and other documents exchanged within W3C will
be electronic (e.g., email, mailing lists, and the Web site).</EM>
<H3>
  <A name="Members">2.1 - Members</A>
</H3>
<H4>
  <A name="MemberProfiles">2.1.1 - Member profiles</A>
</H4>
<P>
In its quest for universality, W3C seeks a diverse membership from around
the world. To meet the needs of a heterogeneous global population of Web
users, W3C interacts with vendors of technology products and services, content
providers, corporate users, research laboratories, standards bodies, and
governments. By working together, W3C's member organizations (hereafter,
"Members") reach <A href="#Consensus">consensus</A> on specifications, thus
encouraging stability in this rapidly evolving technology. W3C also maintains
close ties with related organizations such as the IETF, notably for the
development of specifications.
<P>
At all times, the list of <A href="#ref-current-mem">current W3C Members
[PUB8]</A> may be found at the W3C Web site.
<H4>
  <A name="MemberBenefits">2.1.2 - Member benefits</A>
</H4>
<P>
W3C Members enjoy the following benefits:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A seat on the Advisory Committee
  <LI>
    The ability to provide strategic direction to W3C
  <LI>
    Participation in W3C activities
  <LI>
    Access to the Member Web site, which includes newsletters, announcements,
    and information on events, technologies, software releases, activities, forums,
    and mailing lists.
  <LI>
    The ability to display the W3C logo on promotional material and reference
    the member's W3C participation
</UL>
<H4>
  <A name="MemberSubscription">2.1.3 - Member subscription</A>
</H4>
<P>
The <A href="#ref-join-w3c">conditions and procedures for joining W3C
[PUB5]</A> are described at the W3C Web site.
<P>
Companies and organizations may subscribe according to a
<A href="#ref-full-member">Full Member agreement [PUB6]</A> or an
<A href="#ref-affiliate-member">Affiliate Member agreement [PUB7]</A>.

<P>W3C has no membership class for individuals, although individuals
may participate in W3C's activities via W3C's public mailing lists.
Individuals may also participate as invited experts at the Director's
discretion, or may join W3C as Affiliate Members.

<H4>
  <A name="MemberRelated">2.1.4 - Related Members</A>
</H4>

<P>W3C Membership is open to all entities (as described in <a
href="#ref-join-w3c">How to Join W3C [PUB5]</a>). In the interest of
ensuring the integrity of the consensus process, W3C may limit the
influence of <em><dfn>related</dfn></em> Members in some
circumstances. As used herein, two Members are related if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either Member is a subsidiary of the other, or 
<li>Both Members are subsidiaries of a common third party.
</ol>

<P>A <em><dfn>subsidiary</dfn></em> is an organization of which
effective control and/or majority ownership rests with another, single
organization.

<P>Under any circumstance where restrictions apply to related Members,
it is the responsibility of those Members to disclose the
relationship.


<H3>
  <A name="Team">2.2 - Team</A>
</H3>
<P>
The W3C Team consists of a Chairman, a Director and Staff. The Team coordinates
the global activities of W3C. It is their responsibility to:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Provide direction to W3C by keeping up-to-date on new technology, market
    fluctuations, and the activities of related organizations.
  <LI>
    Ensure cooperation between Members while still promoting competition.
  <LI>
    Encourage Member initiatives and submissions and establish efficient
    administrative mechanisms that allow these initiatives to flourish.
  <LI>
    Organize and manage W3C activities so as to optimize the achievement of goals
    within practical constraints such as resources available;
  <LI>
    Keep Members abreast of  W3C activities.
  <LI>
    Inform the general public of W3C activities and gather ideas and input from
    outside sources.
  <LI>
    Market W3C results to gain wide acceptance for them in the Web community.
  <LI>
    Market W3C to attract new Members -- the larger the member base, the easier
    it will be to promote W3C Recommendations.
</UL>
<P>
The specific roles of the W3C Chairman, W3C Director and W3C Staff members
are described throughout this process document.
<P>
This document describes expectations the Members have of the Team and the
Team of the Members. Activities of W3C take place through the actions of
the Team, and mechanisms and procedures set in place by the Team, which are
not described in detail in this document.   The Team provides such
information primarily on the Member Web site as the primary resource, and
is personally at the disposition of members through the appropriate staff
contact.
<P>
To improve the cooperation between the Members and the Team, Member organizations
may send visiting engineers to work with the Team on host sites.
<H3>
  <A name="AC">2.3 - Advisory Committee</A>
</H3>
<P>
The Advisory Committee (AC) has several roles within W3C:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Review technical specifications (that may become <A href="#Recs">W3C
    Recommendations</A>)
  <LI>
    Review annual plans
  <LI>
    Assess the W3C's progress
  <LI>
    Suggest future directions for W3C
</UL>
<H4>
  <A name="ACParticipation">2.3.1 - Participation</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Advisory Committee consists of one representative from each Member
organization. This representative is named in the Membership Agreement
when the organization <A href="#ref-join-w3c">joins W3C [PUB5]</A>.
When a Member organization wishes to change its AC
representative, the departing representative should notify
the Director of the change by email. If
the departing AC representative cannot be contacted, the new
representative shall be confirmed by a responsible officer of the
Member organization.

<P>
The AC representative is the official link between the Member organization
and the Team. Thus, the AC representative is responsible for receiving
information from the Team (such as the newsletter, calls for interest,
participation, votes, etc.) on behalf of the  Member organization,
and acting as the conduit for the Member organization's official statements,
positions, votes, and submissions to the Team.
<P>
The specific roles of the AC representatives are described throughout this
process document.
<P>
At all times, the list of <A href="#ref-current-ac"> current Advisory Committee
representatives [MEM1]</A> is available at the Web site.
<H4>
  <A name="ACCommunication">2.3.2 - Communication</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Advisory Committee will make use of the following communication mechanisms:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Within the AC: A mailing list open only to AC representatives, for internal
    discussions.
  <LI>
    Within W3C: A mailing list for communication between the Team and the AC
    representatives.
</UL>
<P>
The names of <A href="#ref-mailing-lists">AC mailing lists [MEM2]</A> may
be found at the W3C Web site.
<P>
At each Advisory Committee meeting, the W3C Team will provide Member
organizations with an update of key W3C information, including:
<DL>
  <DT>
    <EM>Resources</EM>
  <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The number of Full and Affiliate W3C Members.
      <LI>
	An overview of the financial status of W3C.
    </UL>
  <DT>
    <EM>Allocations</EM>
  <DD>
    <UL>
      <LI>
	The allocation of the annual budget, including size of the Team and their
	approximate deployment.
      <LI>
	A list of all activities and brief status statement about each.
      <LI>
	A list of activities started since the previous AC meeting.
      <LI>
	A list of activities completed or terminated since the previous AC meeting.
    </UL>
  <DD>
</DL>
<H4>
  <A name="ACMeetings">2.3.3 - Meetings</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Advisory Committee will hold face-to-face meetings approximately twice
a year. These meetings will be geographically distributed to areas where
there is a significant portion of the membership.
<P>

<P>The date and location of each meeting shall be announced at least six
months (and preferably one year) before the planned date. In general,
only one representative from each Member organization attends each AC
meeting. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., a period of transition
between representatives from an organization), the Member may petition
the Director for permission to send a second representative.

<P>
At least eight weeks before an AC meeting, a mailing list will be established
(and AC representatives notified) by which AC representatives may suggest
topics of discussion for the meeting. Suggestions must also be sent to the
mailing list for internal AC discussions. The agenda for the meeting will
be prepared by the Team two weeks before the meeting. The agenda will incorporate
Member suggestions, Team reports required by the W3C process, and other topics
approved by the Director.
<P>
Advisory Committee meetings are chaired by the Chairman. Minutes of the meeting
must be posted within two weeks after the meeting. These minutes will include
the agenda, a summary of discussions, and any action items identified during
the meeting.
<P>
<A href="#ref-ac-meetings">Information about future and past meetings
[MEM5]</A> (schedules, minutes, etc.) may be found at all times at the W3C
Web site.
<H4>
  <A name="ACVotes">2.3.4 - Votes</A>
</H4>

<P>
From time to time, Advisory Committee representatives will be asked to vote
whether to initiate an activity, whether to approve a Proposed Recommendation,
etc. An announcement requesting votes will be sent to the Advisory
Committee; all votes must be received within four weeks thereafter.
Votes must be sent to the address indicated in the announcement.

<P>
Each <a href="#MemberRelated">unrelated</a> Member organization is
allowed one vote through its AC representative.  Each group of related
Members is also allowed one vote, exercised by an AC representative
chosen by the group. In the event that the AC representative is unable
to vote, another person in the organization may submit the vote
accompanied by a statement that the voter is acting on behalf of the
official representative. The official representative must receive a
copy of this vote. If more than one vote is received from a Member
organization, the votes are counted as one valid vote if they agree,
otherwise they are ignored and the AC representative will be notified
of the discrepancy.

<P>
Any vote may include comments, but all <EM>No</EM> votes must be accompanied
by substantive comments explaining the voter's rationale.

<P>
Comments (e.g., issues of intellectual property rights) accumulated
during the voting period shall be sent to all AC representatives
within one week after the end of the voting period. If any <EM>No</EM>
votes are received, for a two-week period, representatives may request
to re-vote based on comments and other new information.  If five
percent or more of the representatives (or fewer at the discretion of
the Director) request to re-vote, the entire voting process will start

<P>Once all voting has ceased, the Director may elect to do one of the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Approve the proposal.
<li>Approve the proposal with minor changes indicated.
<li>Return the proposal for work, with a request to the initiator to
address certain issues.
<li>Reject the proposal.

  <A name="CG">2.4 - Communication Team</A>
</H3>
<P>
A Communication Team will be responsible for managing communication within
W3C and between W3C and the general public. The goals of the Communication
Team are the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Disseminate key information appropriately, whether the scope is within W3C
    or around the world.
  <LI>
    Protect confidential information.
  <LI>
    Keep Member organizations abreast of W3C activities: the progress of groups,
    changes in membership status, release of press information, etc.
  <LI>
    Publicize W3C's activities through press releases.
  <LI>
    Strengthen W3C's image in the Web community through good public relations.
  <LI>
    Establish efficient communication tools that promote fairness, openness,
    and participation within W3C.
  <LI>
    Ensure that W3C communication observes legal requirements, such as those
    relating to anti-trust laws.
  <LI>
    Maintain an accurate historical record of W3C activities and accomplishments.
  <LI>
    Assist Advisory Committee representatives in their role as communicators
    within their organizations.
  <LI>
    Help Member companies who wish to contribute their resources (notably for
    communication) to W3C activities.
</UL>
<P>
Unless otherwise stated (e.g., in legal matters), electronic documents have
primacy over paper documents. When legal notifications, contracts, and other
forms of communication requiring hardcopy must be exchanged between the Team
and a Member organization, they must be sent to the appropriate Advisory
Committee representative via a guaranteed-delivery service. Billing information
may be sent to the designated contact person for each Member organization.
<P>
The primary language for W3C is English.
<H4>
  <A name="CGParticipation">2.4.1 - Participation</A>

The Communication Team will be made up of W3C Team members.
<H4>
  <A name="CGCommunication">2.4.2 - Communication</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Communication Team will use a variety of mechanisms to complete its tasks.
<H5>
  W3C Web site
</H5>
<P>
The W3C World Wide Web server has the address
<A href="http://www.w3.org/"><B>http://www.w3.org/</B></A>. All documents,
archives, and updates must be published at this site. The Web site must be
kept up-to-date by the Communication Team and all other contributors to the
site. Because the Web site is the sole source of so much critical information,
every reasonable means must be used to guarantee its availability at all
times. W3C assumes that public information on the Web site has a world-wide
audience.
<P>
A portion of the Web site, known as the <EM>Member Web site</EM>, will be
reserved for access by authorized W3C Members, Team, and other authorized
people only. At all times, Members have access to all information at this
site.
<P>
All documents appearing on the Member Web site must be respected by those
authorized to consult the site as confidential within W3C. W3C Members must
agree to use reasonable efforts to maintain this confidentiality and not
to release this information to the general public or press. Documents that
require particularly confidential treatment must be marked as such.
<P>
A suitable security mechanism, managed by the Team, will be used to screen
out unauthorized viewing and each AC representative will be instructed on
how to gain access. The AC representative may extend access to Members-only
information to those fellow employees considered by the representative to
be appropriate recipients. All recipients are expected to respect the intended
(limited) scope of Members-only information.
<P>
The Member Web site includes a <A href="#ref-mem-help">help page [MEM6]</A>
to assist Members in finding the right contact or location for information.
<P>
A portion of the Member Web site will be reserved for each W3C
<A href="#GAGroups">group</A>. It is each group's responsibility to maintain
its own archives (minutes, mailing lists, etc.) at this space. See the section
on <A href="#GroupWebSite">group Web sites</A> for more information.
<P>
The following types of documents must be available to the general public
on the Web site at all times:
<UL>
  <LI>
    A <A href="#ref-vision">vision statement [PUB15]</A> that explains the purpose
    and mission of W3C, the key benefits for Members, and the organizational
    structure of W3C.
  <LI>
    Legal documents, including the Membership contract and a review of any legal
    commitments W3C may have to other entities (in particular, the legal status
    of W3C with respect to host institutions).
  <LI>
    The process document describing the governing methods used in W3C activities,
    particularly those which involve Member participation.
  <LI>
    Results of W3C activities, standards efforts, and special events.
</UL>
<P>
The Communication Team will maintain a document registry on the Web site.
This registry will archive all active and obsolete W3C documents (including
URLs to each document) that bear a <A href="#DocumentName">document name</A>.
<P>
The Web site will also provide references to pertinent sources of information
(electronic or other). This will allow W3C Members and the Team to keep
up-to-date on external activities, and will lend credibility to W3C's Web
site as a trustworthy source of impartial and quality information about the
Web.
<H5>
  Mailing Lists
</H5>

<P>The W3C Team will maintain one mailing list for all official
communications to AC representatives. The email
address of each Member organization's AC representative will
be on this list.

<P>The W3C Team will maintain one mailing list for sending general
information to W3C Members (including Newsletters, News announcements,
etc).  The email address of each Member organization's AC
representative will be on this list.

<P>For both lists, the AC representative's email address should
suffice. However, upon request from the AC representative and subject
to approval by the Communication Team, additional addresses for the
Member organization may be added to each list.  The Member company
must agree that redistribution of W3C mailings will be for internal
use only. Failure to contain distribution internally may result in
suspension of additional email addresses until the W3C Team can be
assured of appropriate distribution.

<P>An AC representative may ask the Director, at the Director's
discretion, to forward an open letter to either list.

<P>The Communication Team may also establish other mailing lists to
facilitate communication within a group. Only members of the group and
W3C Team may be listed in such a mailing list. Each group is
responsible for maintaining archives of these mailing lists on its
group space.
<P>
For interaction with the general public, the Communication Team maintains
general mailing lists to which anyone may subscribe and send messages.
<P>
The list of <A href="#ref-mailing-lists">available mailing lists [MEM2]</A>
may be found at the W3C Web site.
<H5>
  Press Releases
</H5>
<P>
The Communication Team will establish a mechanism for confirming and releasing
W3C information to the press and/or general public. Press releases and comments
to the press and public are primarily issued at the discretion of the W3C
Director, except for those processes explicitly defined in this document.
<H5>
  Calendar of Events
</H5>
<P>
To promote the active and open participation of all Member organizations,
the Communication Team will maintain a <A href="#ref-calendar">calendar
[MEM3]</A> of events that shows all scheduled official events of W3C.
Consortium-wide events will be differentiated from group events on this calendar.
Archives of the calendar will be maintained on the Member Web site, with
links to conclusions, email archives, and minutes from scheduled events.
<P>
Members and the Team should notify the Communication Team of events and schedules
that should appear on the calendar and of changes to the calendar. The
Communication Team will also notify Members of upcoming events through one
of the Member mailing lists.
<H5>
  Newsletter
</H5>
<P>
The Communication Team will publish a <A href="#ref-newsletter">newsletter
[MEM4]</A> containing updates on W3C activities, announcements of meetings,
workshops and conferences, and a calendar of upcoming events.
<H3>
  <A name="Hosts">2.5 - Host Institutions</A>
</H3>
<P>
The W3C Team is currently located on three continents at three host institutions:
<UL>

    Science [MIT/LCS].
  <LI>
    In Europe: Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique
    [INRIA].
  <LI>
    In Asia: Keio University [KEIO].
</UL>
<P>
W3C is not a legal entity. W3C contracts and details of Membership are
established between each Member company and the host institutions. Host
institutions pledge that no Member will receive preferential treatment within
W3C and that individual contracts will remain confidential.
<P>
Internal administrative details, including staff salaries, detailed budgeting,
and other business decisions must be held in confidentiality between the
Team and the host institutions.

This section of the document specifies the mechanisms by which W3C initiates
activities, forms groups, and organizes events.
<H3>
  <A name="GAActivities">3.1 - Activities</A>
</H3>
<P>
When W3C decides to become involved in an area of Web technology or policy,
it initiates an activity in that area. The activity is carried out by one
or more <A href="#GAGroups">groups</A>, which may already exist or be created
for the purpose of pursuing the new activity (e.g., as the result of a workshop
on how to organize the activity).
<P>
At all times, the W3C Web site publishes the <A href="#ref-activity-list">list
of activities currently being pursued by W3C [PUB9].</A>
<P>
A technological or policy area not declared at the Web site is not the object
of a W3C activity.
<H4>
  <A name="ActivityProposal">3.1.1 - Proposing an activity</A>
</H4>
<P>
To initiate an activity, any W3C Member may submit an activity proposal to
the Director. Acceptance by the Director implies that there is adequate interest
to commit W3C resources to the next phase.
<P>
Members of the Team can also propose an activity subject to the Director's
approval, if they believe that there is adequate Member interest to warrant
the activity. The Team may solicit Member input when compiling its activity
briefing package.
<H5>
  Activity briefing packages
</H5>
<P>
Each activity proposal must be accompanied by an
<A name="briefing"><EM>activity briefing package</EM></A> that defines the
activity. The issues discussed in the activity briefing package depend on
the nature of the activity. For a technical or strategic activity, the activity
briefing package must address the following questions:
<OL>
  <LI>
    What is the market within the area of the proposal?
    <UL>
      <LI>
	Who or what group wants this (providers, users, etc.)? What community will
	benefit from this activity? Are members of this community part of W3C now?
	Will they join the effort?
      <LI>
	Who or what currently exists in the market?
      <LI>
	Is the market mature/growing/developing a niche?
      <LI>
	What competing technologies exist? What competing organizations exist?
    </UL>
  <LI>
    What Team resources will be consumed (technical and administrative)?
  <LI>
    What is the scope of the work?
  <LI>
    What are initial timetables? Is there a window of opportunity that cannot
    be missed?
  <LI>
    What intellectual property (for example, an implementation) must be available
    for licensing and is this intellectual property available for a reasonable
    fee and in a non-discriminatory manner?
  <LI>
    How might a potential Recommendation interact and overlap with existing
    international standards and Recommendations? What organizations are likely
    to be affected by potential overlap?
  <LI>
    Is this activity likely to fall within the dominion of an existing group?
    Should new groups be created? How should they be coordinated?
</OL>
<P>
For a policy or process issue, the activity briefing package must address
the following questions:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Why is this proposal being made now?
  <LI>
    What Team resources will be consumed (technical and administrative)?
  <LI>
    What is the scope of the work?
  <LI>
    What are initial timetables? Is there a window of opportunity that cannot
    be missed?
  <LI>
    What must be changed if the process is put into place?
  <LI>
    Is this activity likely to fall within the dominion of an existing group?
    Should new groups be created? How should they be coordinated?
</OL>
<P>
The briefing package must specify the structure of groups and/or events foreseen
for the proposed activity. The briefing package must also contain the provisional
<A href="#GeneralCharters">charters</A> for any groups that will be created
as a result of the briefing package. Groups may be scheduled to run concurrently
or sequentially (either because of a dependency or an expected overlap in
membership and the desirability of working on one subject at a time).
<P>
The briefing package may specify the threshold level of effort that Members
must pledge in order for the activity to be accepted.
<P>
The W3C Web site contains an <A href="#ref-bp-overview">activity briefing
package overview [PUB12]</A>, including samples.
<H5>
  Assigning a new work item to an existing group
</H5>
<P>
If the submitters of an activity briefing package wish to assign a new work
item to the charter of an existing group, they must first consult with the
group Chair. The Chair may judge whether the Group is appropriate for pursuing
the work item in question. <A href="#Consensus">Consensus</A> about whether
an existing group will pursue a new work item must be reached before the
activity briefing package is submitted to the Director.
<P>
Group members who do not agree with the Chair's decision may raise objections
through their AC representative. In cases of unresolved disagreement, the
final decision is the responsibility of the Coordination Group Chair if the
group is part of a Coordination Group. Otherwise, the Director decides whether
the existing group or groups will pursue the new work item.
<P>
If it is decided that an existing group will pursue a new work item, the
group's charter must be amended accordingly.
<H4>
  <A name="ActivityRejection">3.1.2 - Rejection of the activity proposal</A>
</H4>
<P>
The Director has the role of acknowledging or rejecting an activity proposal.
<P>
If a proposal is rejected, the Director must provide the submitter(s) with
a justification for the rejection.
<H4>
  <A name="ActivityAcceptance">3.1.3 - Acceptance of the activity proposal</A>
</H4>
<P>
If an activity proposal is acknowledged, it must be amended by the submitter
with a detailed W3C resource statement (administrative, technical, and
financial). The Director may also request an indication of resource commitment
on the part of the submitter(s).
<P>
At this point, the activity proposal and supporting documents are sent to
all Advisory Committee representatives, accompanied by a ballot. The AC
representatives have four weeks to study the proposal and return their ballot
with any comments. Comments that demonstrate serious flaws in the proposal,
reflect burdensome resource allocations, reveal invalid or confused deployment
methodologies, or illustrate an "out of scope proposal" are critical to the
outcome of a proposal.
<P>
AC members are encouraged to include information in their ballots that might
help the submitters amend their provisional charter, should the activity
briefing package be accepted. Topics of particular importance include how
the activity relates to existing activities in other organizations, how a
Recommendation might relate to an existing international standard, etc. All
comments will be archived so that anyone on the AC may review them.
<P>
The Director will review all comments and decide whether to accept or reject
the proposal. The final decision will be based on the AC representatives'
comments, projections as to whether W3C is likely to achieve market consensus,
and the Director's personal and professional experience.
<P>
The first meeting of a group carrying out a new activity may occur, at the
earliest, four weeks after the submission of the activity briefing package.
The proposed date of the first meeting must be indicated in the activity
briefing package.
<H4>
  <A NAME="ActivityStatement">3.1.4 - Activity Statements</A>
</H4>
<P>
Once an activity has been accepted, the Team must publish the briefing package
information on the public Web site as an <EM>activity statement</EM>. The
information may be amended as a result of Member or Team comments, to remove
confidential information regarding Member or Team staffing levels, etc.
The activity statement should be revised at least before each ordinary Advisory
Committee meeting to include a current description of the activity, its goals,
and rationale. Revised versions should include a statement of delivered work.
If the analysis made in the initial briefing package becomes outdated, the
revision should clearly state so.
<P>
Recall that at all times, the W3C Web site publishes the
<A href="#ref-activity-list">list of activities currently being pursued by
W3C [PUB9].</A>
<H4>
  <A NAME="ActivityModification">3.1.5 - Revised Activity Statements</A>
</H4>
<P>
An activity statement may be modified such that details (e.g., in group charters)
are elaborated or adjusted to meet the goals of the activity within the spirit
of the original briefing package. The Director must decide whether a revised
activity statement continues to reflect the spirit of the briefing package.
AC representatives may appeal this decision to the Advisory Committee.
<P>
If the Director decides that a revised activity statement no longer reflects
the spirit of the original briefing package (e.g., it requires a substantial
increase in resources, a change in scope, etc.), then the current activity
must cease in its current form and a new activity must be proposed, according
to the <A href="#ActivityProposal">procedure for new activities.</A> The
revised activity statement should be part of the briefing package for the
new activity.
<H4>
  <A name="ActivityTermination">3.1.6 - Premature termination of an activity</A>
</H4>
<P>
Any activity may be terminated prematurely in the following circumstances:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Groups pursuing the activity fail to meet the established deliverables in
    their charters.
  <LI>
    Groups have delivered their results in advance.
  <LI>
    There are insufficient resources to maintain the activity, according to
    priorities established by the Advisory Committee and the Director.

<P>
All groups abide by the following procedures.
<H4>
  <A name="GeneralChairs">3.2.1 - Chairs</A>
</H4>
<P>
Every group must have one Chair to coordinate the group's activities. The
Chair is appointed (or reappointed) by the Director.
<H4>
  <A name="GeneralCharters">3.2.2 - Charters</A>
</H4>
<P>
Every group must have a charter that describes the following:
<UL>
  <LI>
    the group's mission statement,
  <LI>
    the scope of the group's work items and criteria for success,
  <LI>
    the forecast duration of the work items. Groups are expected to carry out
    their activities for a period lasting from six months up to two years.
  <LI>
    the nature of the deliverables to be produced (including minutes, reports,
    Proposed Recommendations, and software), their frequency, and the process
    for the group members to approve the release of these deliverables.
  <LI>
    for dependencies of other groups on this group, define the group(s) that
    require the deliverables and how communication about the deliverables
    (contact people, Coordination Groups, W3C contacts, etc) will take
    place.
  <LI>
    for dependencies of this group on other groups, define the 
    expected time of delivery, or specified
    level of conformance of groups, or requirements document. If a 
    Coordination Group is managing a Working Group, the Coordination
    Group must monitor these dependencies to ensure they are respected;
    otherwise the Working Group Chair has this responsibility.
    For example, one group's charter may specify that another group
    must review a specification before that document can become a
    Recommendation. A Coordination Group must ensure that this 
    review takes place.
  <LI>
    the intended degree of confidentiality of the Group proceedings and its
    deliverables (Group, Members, Public). In particular, whether the charter
    itself is for Members' eyes only or is a public document.
  <LI>
    a statement about how the group's activities and deliverables relate to and
    depend on the activities and deliverables of other groups (external or W3C).
  <LI>
    milestones for work items and deliverables,
  <LI>
    meeting mechanisms and schedules,
  <LI>
    communication mechanisms to be employed within the group, between the group
    and the rest of W3C, and with the general public. The scope of each communication
    mechanism must be clearly indicated in the charter,
  <LI>
    voting mechanisms,
  <LI>
    the level of involvement of the Team (track developments, write and edit
    specifications, develop code, organize pilot experiments).
  <LI>
    the W3C staff contact if known,
  <LI>
    an estimate of the time commitment a group member would have to make in order
    to participate in the above.
</UL>
<P>
The group's charter must be approved by the Director. .
<H5>
  Renewal or Modification of a Charter
</H5>
<P>
When a group's work lasts longer than the time period specified by its charter
and there is <A href="#Consensus">consensus</A> that the group should continue,
the charter may be renewed.
<P>
If the group whose charter is about to expire is a "top level" group (i.e.,
a Coordination Group, Project, Interest Group, or sole Working Group), the
charter must be revised and submitted to the Advisory Committee for approval.
<P>
If the group whose charter is about to expire is managed by a "top level"
group, the revised charter must be approved by the Director. The Director
must announce that the charter has been prolonged to the Advisory Committee.
Such charters are assumed to have been approved by the AC four weeks after
the Director's announcement unless at least 5% of the AC representatives
request to vote on the revised charter during that period.
<P>
The same process applies to charters that must be modified for any reason
(e.g., the addition of a new work item).

  <LI>
    <A href="#GroupsP">Projects</A>. Projects focus more on systems that make
    use of Web technology rather than Web technology itself. To this end, a Project
    must facilitate communication between Working Groups and Interest Groups,
    but also organizations outside of W3C.
</UL>
<P>
The following sections describe the procedures that govern each type of group.
<H4>
  <A name="GroupsWG">3.3.1 - Working Groups</A>
</H4>
<P>
A Working Group's purpose is to study a technical or policy issue involving
the Web and to develop proposals for W3C Recommendations.
<P>
Working Groups are created according to the procedures indicated in this
document, including the procedure for <A href="#GeneralCharters">charter
submission and approval</A>.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are intended to be small (typically
less than 15 people) and composed of experts in the area defined by the charter.
The following people may participate in a Working Group on an ongoing basis:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Representatives of W3C Member organizations. If a participant does not speak
    on behalf of the organization for which the participant works, this must
    be indicated in the charter.
  <LI>
    Experts who do not belong to a Member organization. These participants must
    be approved by the Working Group Chair. Experts may participate in Working
    Group votes if the Charter explicitly requires it..
</UL>
<P>
Participation on an ongoing basis implies a serious commitment to the Working
Group charter. Participation includes:
<UL>
  <LI>
    attending most meetings of the Working Group
  <LI>
    providing deliverables or drafts of deliverables in a timely fashion
  <LI>
    being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group, including
    minutes of past meetings (for new participants)
</UL>
<P>
Participants who meet these criteria (and new participants) are considered
to be "participants in good standing".  If a participant cannot meet
these criteria, either (a) by missing more than one of every three remote
meetings or more than one of every three face-to-face meetings, or (b) by
not providing deliverables in a timely fashion twice in sequence, the participant
falls out of good standing. The AC representative of a participant's
organization will be informed of all failures by the participant to remain
in good standing.
<P>
The Chair may relax the attendance requirement for expensive meetings
(international phone calls or travel) for invited experts who do not have
financial support.
<P>
The status of voting participant may be regained by meeting the participation
requirements for two consecutive meetings.
<P>
Good standing is required to be able to vote. Those not in good standing
(and their alternates) are dropped from the Working Group
mailing lists. 
<P>
 W3C considers that a Member organization is participating in a Working
Group if at least one representative from the organization is in good standing.
<P>
The following may participate in a Working Group on a one-time basis:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Experts who may or may not belong to a Member organization. These participants
    must be approved by the Working Group Chair. They may not participate in
    Working Group votes.
</UL>
<P>
One-time participation implies no commitment from the participant and nor
does it imply future participation or invitation to Working Group meetings.
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Please consult the section on <A href="#GeneralCommunication">group
communication</A> for information about mailing lists and group Web sites.
<H5>
  Meetings
</H5>
<P>
Working Groups will organize both remote and face-to-face meetings.
<H5>
  <A name="WGVotes">Votes</A>
</H5>
<P>
From time to time, Working Group participants may choose to vote on issues
such as the details of a specification. Only participants in good standing
may vote. All votes shall be sent to both the group Chair (or a designee)
and the Working Group mailing list.
<P>
The purpose of a Working Group vote is to identify roadblocks to
<A href="#Consensus">consensus</A>, and thus the voting process is designed
to solicit constructive criticism from voters. All <EM>No</EM> votes must
be accompanied by either a list of modifications that would change the vote
to <EM>Yes</EM>, or an explanation as to why the project should be abandoned.

<P>If more than one vote is received from a Member organization or a
group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related</a> Members, the votes are
counted as one valid vote if they agree, otherwise they are ignored
and the relevant Advisory Committee representatives(s) will be
notified of the discrepancy.

<P>
Once all votes have been received, the Chair is responsible for
resolving the issues that motivated the <EM>No</EM> votes. The Chair
may do so either by revising the deliverable in such a way as to take
the comments into account, or by providing a reason why the comment is
not valid. The Chair may also eliminate stumbling blocks to <A
href="#Consensus">consensus</A> by creating two deliverables instead
of one -- one for those topics amenable to consensus, the other for
those topics requiring further study or agreement.
<P>
A successful <I>yes</I> vote occurs when three-fourths of the voting participants
have voted <I>yes</I> and when the Working Group Chair decides that all
substantive <EM>No</EM> comments have been addressed.
<P>
A Working Group may write slightly different voting rules into its charter.
If such a charter is approved, those Working Group-specific voting rules
will apply.
<H5>
  Deliverables
</H5>
<P>
Each Working Group will post its intermediate results (called
<A href="#RecsWD">working drafts</A>) to a public area of the Working Group
Web space. Working drafts will be labeled as such. They will also include
the following disclaimer in a section specifying the status of the document:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  This is an working draft. W3C is not responsible for any implementations
  based on this draft. This draft may or may not be proposed as a Recommendation,
  and may change at any time and without notice.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
If a deliverable is code, proofs of concept and demonstrations should be
published along with the code.
<P>
The Team and any Coordination Groups whose scope includes the Working Group
should be notified whenever there is a likelihood that a deliverable may
not be produced on time, and a new date negotiated.
<P>
In addition to the deliverables specified in the Working Group charter, a
Working Group will post its intermediate results to a public area of the
Working Group Web site at three month intervals. The Working Group charter
must specify the process for approving the release of these intermediate
reports.
<H4>
  <A name="GroupsIG">3.3.2 - Interest Groups</A>
</H4>
<P>
An Interest Group brings together people who wish to evaluate potential Web
technologies and policies. An Interest Group does not have the goals of a
Working Group -- development of specifications or code. Instead, it serves
as a forum to explore cooperation and exchange ideas.
<P>
It is quite possible that an Interest Group's studies will lead to the creation
of a Working Group, but this may not be known in advance nor is it guaranteed.
Interest Groups are created according to the procedures indicated in this
document, including the procedure for <A href="#GeneralCharters">charter
submission and approval</A>.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
Interest Group Membership is not, in principle, limited in size. The following
people may participate in an Interest Group on an ongoing basis:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Representatives of W3C organizations. If a participant does not speak on
    behalf of the organization for which the participant works, this must be
    indicated in the charter.
  <LI>
    Non-members. The Interest Group Chair may invite non-members to participate
    when the Chair deems their participating appropriate.
</UL>
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Please consult the section on <A href="#GeneralCommunication">group
communication</A> for information about mailing lists and group Web sites.
<H5>
  Meetings
</H5>
<P>
Interest Groups will organize both remote and face-to-face meetings, but
remote meetings should be the more common mode of communication.
<H5>
  Votes
</H5>
<P>
From time to time, Interest Group participants may choose to vote on issues
of policy or direction.

<P>In an Interest Group, each Member organization or group of <a
href="#MemberRelated">related</a> Members is allowed one vote, even
though each Member may have several participants in the group. If more
than one vote is received from a Member organization or group of
related Members, the votes are counted as one valid vote if they
agree, otherwise they are ignored and the relevant Advisory Committee
representative(s) will be notified of the discrepancy.

<P>
Voting proceeds as for Working Groups unless otherwise indicated.
<H5>
  Deliverables
</H5>
<P>
The Interest Group charter must specify the type of deliverable the group
intends to produce and with what frequency (e.g., a report summarizing the
group's findings or comments on and requirements for the activities of other
groups).
<H4>
  <A name="GroupsCG">3.3.3 - Coordination Groups</A>
</H4>
<P>
W3C activities interact in many ways.  There are dependencies between
groups within the same Activity or in Activities in different parts of W3C
structure.  There may also be dependencies that have been accepted
between W3C and external groups. The Team should ensure that work throughout
W3C is consistent, and the dependencies are acknowledged and met. Toward
this purpose, Coordination Groups may be created.
<P>
Examples of dependencies include the use by one technology of another technology
in the process of definition by another group, or the scheduling constraints,
or the synchronization of publicity for the announcement of deliverables.
<P>
Coordination Groups are created to manage dependencies between groups within
the well defined scope of a certain issue, or issues.
<P>
For example, a Working Group may decide that to pursue its goals more effectively
it should break down its tasks and assign them to smaller task forces. In
this case, the Chair may ask for a Coordination Group to be formed to manage
the cooperating task forces (which may be either Working Groups or Interest
Groups).
<P>
When Activities are created, dependencies are made as explicit as possible
in the Activity Proposal.  A Coordination Group may be created initially
when an activity is created, by being included in the proposal.  A special
case is that a Coordination Group may be created as an initial and only group,
and tasked with defining the charters of, and proposing new Working Groups
to address the issues within its scope.
<P>
It is also the case that dependencies arise after the creation of groups,
and the Team should ensure that these are recognized, and accepted by the
parties involved.  Whereas generally this happens by direct negotiation
between groups, the Team (through Team contact of the group) and any coordinating
groups must be informed of any new dependency.
<P>
The Team should, where necessary, in consultation with Working Group Chairs,
create and modify Coordination Groups when a new need is seen.  When
the issues within the scope of the Coordination Group are no longer being
(or to be) addressed by W3C, then the Coordination Group should be closed.
<P>
<B><SMALL>Arbitration</SMALL></B>
<P>
W3C is a forum for those wishing to agree; it is not a battleground. 
At times, unforeseen dependencies may arise that are proposed by one group
but that a related group does not wish to accept. Tension may also mount
when expectations defined in a dependency are misunderstood or are not met.
The Team should be informed of such tensions. Where a Coordination Group's
scope covers the issues and parties involved, it is the first locus of resolution
of such tensions.  If agreement cannot be found between the Coordination
Group and other groups involved, then the Team should arbitrate after
consultation with parties involved and other experts, and, if deemed
necessary, the Advisory Committee.
<H5>
</H5>
<H5>
  Charter
</H5>
<P>
The charter of a Coordination Group must specify the scope of the group's
activities and the frequency of its meetings. The charter must also list
the Working Groups or Interest Groups involved and the name of each group's
contact for communication with the Coordination Group.
<P>
The charter of a Coordination Group must also specify whether the group may
create new Working Groups. When new groups are created, they may not exceed
the scope of the Coordination Group. Any proposed Working Group may only
proceed subject to the Director's decision that sufficient Team resources
are available to support it, that the creation of the Working Group has
sufficient mandate from the Advisory Committee without a further briefing
package, and that other organizational and coordination work is not first
required.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
The membership of Coordination Groups should represent the groups involved
in the scope coordinated, and is defined in the charter when the group is
created, and may be modified as groups becomes newly dependent or independent.
To promote effective communication between a Coordination Group and each
group being coordinated, participation in a Coordination Group is mandatory
for the Chair of each group being coordinated. The Group's charter may also
specify other members, either as invited experts in a specific area, or as
liaison with other activity internal or external to W3C. The role of such
additional members should be clearly stated, and whether they are invited
experts specified by name, invited experts in a specific field to be invited
by the Chair, or representatives of particular organizations.
<P>
The Team, in consultation with Working Group Chairs, is responsible for ensuring
that the Coordination Group structure is efficient and appropriate to its
needs at each point in time, and making modifications to the membership as
appropriate.
<P>
The Director appoints the Chair of a Coordination Group unless the majority
of participants of the Coordination Group requests an election of the Chair.
In case of an election, the Chair of the Coordination Group will be elected
by majority vote from and by the membership of the Coordination Group.
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Please consult the section on <A href="#GeneralCommunication">group
communication</A> for information about mailing lists and group Web sites.
<H5>
  Meetings
</H5>
<P>
A Coordination Group will organize remote and/or face-to-face meetings. Reports
of these meetings are to be published to Members on the Coordination Group's
Web space.
<H5>
  Deliverables
</H5>
<P>
A Coordination Group will publish reports on the Member Web site assessing
the activities and progress of the groups it oversees.
<H4>
  <A name="GroupsP">3.3.4 - Projects</A>
</H4>
<P>
Projects are activities that endeavor to develop systems that make use of
Web technology. Projects develop proposals for
<A href="#Recs">Recommendations</A> and implement them in pilot environments
while maintaining close ties with technology innovators, implementors, and
users with very different backgrounds.
<P>
Whereas Coordination Groups coordinate the activities of a set of groups,
Projects involve communication between external organizations and W3C, the
management of software implementations, etc. Due to this additional
responsibility, the Chair of a Project must have the skills of a <EM>project
manager</EM>.
<P>
The Director appoints the Chair of a Project. If the Project includes a
Coordination Group (the usual scenario), it must be chaired by the Project
Chair.
<P>
A Project has the same structure and observe the same processes as a Coordination
Group unless otherwise indicated.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
Projects may engage in partnerships with other organizations. Procedures
for participation must be negotiated between the Project and the external
organization and added to the Project charter.
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Please consult the section on <A href="#GeneralCommunication">group
communication</A> for information about mailing lists and group Web sites.
<H5>
  Deliverables
</H5>
<P>
The Project charter must specify the type of deliverable the group intends
to produce and with what frequency (e.g., Recommendations, prototype software,
reports, etc.).
<H3>
  <A name="GAEvents">3.4 - Events</A>
</H3>
<P>
W3C may organize several types of shorter term events that do not demand
on-going participation by Members or the Team.
<P>
This document defines three types of W3C events:
<UL>
  <LI>
    <A href="#EventsW">Workshops</A>
  <LI>
    <A href="#EventsS">Symposia</A>
  <LI>
    <A href="#EventsC">Conferences</A>
</UL>
<H4>
  <A name="EventsW">3.4.1 - Workshops</A>
</H4>
<P>
A workshop brings experts together for a single meeting, typically for one
or two days. Workshops generally fall into two categories: those convened
so that Members may exchange ideas about a technology or policy and those
convened to address the pressing concerns of W3C Members.
<P>
Organizers of the first type of workshop should use the workshop to gather
information about issues that interest its Members, opportunities to pursue
activities, directions for W3C, and possible resource commitments. The organizers
should plan a workshop program that includes position papers and talks. These
papers should be distributed to other workshop attendees. The organizers
may select among position papers to choose attendees and/or presenters.
<P>
In order to allow speakers and authors adequate preparation time, the workshop
proposal and call for participation must be made no later than eight weeks
prior to the workshop's proposed date.
<P>
Organizers of the second type of workshop have a different goal: to address
concerns of Members and resolve differences as quickly as possible. Although
organizers must clearly specify the scope of the workshop in their proposal,
they will not solicit papers. Due to the more urgent nature of this type
of workshop, the workshop proposal and call for participation must be made
no later than six weeks prior to the workshop's proposed date.
<P>
Either type of workshop may result in a proposal to the W3C to launch a new
Activity or a new Group, but there is no guarantee of subsequent activity
or even a proposal for an activity.
<H5>
  Proposing a Workshop
</H5>
<P>
Either a Member organization or the Team may propose a workshop. However,
it is the Team's responsibility to accept or not, and to schedule the workshop
and coordinate the attendance and program.
<P>
To propose a workshop, a workshop proposal must be drawn up and
circulated to the Advisory Committee according to the aforementioned calendar.
<P>
The proposal must include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    a description of the scope of the workshop and criteria for success.
  <LI>
    the list of the deliverables to be produced (including minutes, reports,
    software, and Recommendations).
  <LI>
    a call for participation.
</UL>
<P>
The proposal must address the following questions:
<UL>
  <LI>
    What community is the audience for this topic? Are members of this community
    part of W3C now? Will they join the effort?
  <LI>
    When and where is the event being called and why will people come to an event
    on the subject?
  <LI>
    What is the expected outcome of the event?
  <LI>
    Can non-members participate? Will they be charged a different fee than Members?
</UL>
<P>
The call for participation must include:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The date, city, and (if possible) exact location of the workshop.
  <LI>
    The attendance criteria for the workshop (for Members as well as non-members).
  <LI>
    The goals of the workshop.
  <LI>
    The fee structure, if any.
  <LI>
    The names of the W3C Team members who will coordinate the workshop
  <LI>
    The names of people to participate on the program committee. The program
    committee should be chaired (or at least co-chaired) by a W3C Team member.
</UL>
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Workshop minutes will be taken by the W3C Team and made available in the
Member Area at the W3C Web site. The minutes of the workshop must be published
at the Member Web site before any further W3C activity can be initiated in
the area addressed by the workshop.
<H5>
  Deliverables
</H5>
<P>
The nature of the deliverables is specified in the workshop proposal.
A W3C Team member will be assigned to edit any conclusions reached as a result
of the workshop (e.g., a proposal that W3C study this activity more in depth
in a new or existing group).
<H4>
  <A name="EventsS">3.4.2 - Symposia</A>
</H4>
<P>
A symposium brings interested parties together for expert presentations on
a given subject. Typically lasting one or two days, a symposium is intended
to educate.
<P>
A symposium is initiated following the same procedure for a workshop aiming
at the exchange of ideas (ie first type). However, the call for participation
to a symposium must include the following information:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The date, city, and (if possible) exact location of the symposium.
  <LI>
    The attendance criteria for the symposium, including the capacity limit.
  <LI>
    The program of the symposium.
  <LI>
    The name of the W3C Team member to chair (or co-chair) the symposium.
</UL>
<P>
There are no deliverables or criteria for success for a symposium.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
A symposium is open to all W3C Member organizations. Seats should be allocated
evenly to all W3C Member organizations, but seats not claimed one month before
the registration deadline may be released and re-allocated equitably to other
W3C Members.
<H5>
  Communication
</H5>
<P>
Minutes shall be taken by the W3C Team and made available at the Member Web
site.
<H4>
  <A name="EventsC">3.4.3 - Conferences</A>
</H4>
<P>
A conference is a large, multi-subject, multi-day meeting. W3C does not,
as a general rule, organize conferences. It does, however, sponsor the World
Wide Web Conference. This conference is coordinated by the
<A href="http://www.iw3c2.org/">International World Wide Web Conference Committee
(IW3C2)</A>.
<H3>
  <A name="GAProcess">3.5 - Process</A>
</H3>
<P>
<H4>
  <A name="ProcessAmendment">3.5.1 - Amendments to the process </A>
</H4>
<P>
Like any other activity in W3C, the W3C process may require amendment from
time to time.
<P>
When expected changes are major (important and numerous), a Working Group
must be created to draft a proposal for changes. The section on
<A href="#ActivityProposal">proposing an activity</A> for information about
creating a Process Working Group applies to this situation.
<P>
When expected changes are medium (important but few), the Director may decide
that the creation of a Process Working Group is not warranted. In this case,
the Director may write a proposal for changes and send a ballot directly
to AC representatives for a vote.
<P>
When changes are minor (clarification rather than content), the Director
may decide to implement them and notify the Advisory Committee. Such changes
are assumed to have been approved by the AC four weeks after the Director's
announcement unless at least 5% of the AC representatives request to vote
on the revised process during that period.
<H5>
  Participation
</H5>
<P>
Participation in a Process Working Group is open to any AC representative.
Participants are expected to attend all the W3C AC meetings that take place
during the projected life-span of the Working Group.
<H5>
  Votes
</H5>
<P>
Voting will proceed as for <A href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</A>
related to Recommendations.
<H4>
  <A name="ProcessDoc">3.5.2 - The process document</A>
</H4>
<P>
The process document describes the processes that govern the activity of
W3C. The process document must be revised after a decision to modify the
process.
<P>
When a Process Working Group is created to modify the process (major changes),
its charter must propose the editor(s) who will revise the process
document.
<P>
When no Process Working Group is created to modify the process (medium or
minor changes), the Director appoints the editor(s) who will revise the process
document.

<H3>
  <A name="ParticipationCriteria">3.6 - Individual participation criteria</A>
</H3>
<P>
There are three requirements an individual must satisfy in order to belong
to the W3C Team or participate in a W3C activity (e.g., act as a Chair, editor,
etc.):
<UL>
  <LI>
    Demonstrable technical competence in one's role
  <LI>
    The ability to act fairly
  <LI>
    Social competence in one's role
</UL>
<P>
Generally, the best assessment of whether an individual satisfies these criteria
is the <A href="#Consensus">consensus</A> of colleagues. Consensus on the
nature of individual roles can greatly facilitate the process of reaching
consensus on technical issues.
<P>
Individuals participating in a W3C activity (e.g., within a Working Group)
represent not only their own ideas but also the interests of the companies
or organizations with which they have relationships. As these companies and
organizations are often Members of W3C, all participants in a W3C activity
should clearly disclose, as is customary, the financial interests and
affiliations they have with W3C Members. These disclosures should be kept
up-to-date as the individual's professional relationships and W3C Membership
evolve.
<P>
The ability of an individual to fulfill a role within a group without risking
a conflict of interests is clearly a function of the individual's affiliations.
When these affiliations change, the role in question must be reassigned,
possibly to the same individual, according to the process appropriate to
the role.
<P>
When an individual accepts a role as Chair or editor, the Member organization
that employs that individual recognizes that this work as unbiased officer
of the Group is done as part of the individual's work for the Member.
<P>
To formalize an individual's commitment to a role, the individual must specify
in writing (by email or letter):
<UL>
  <LI>
    the anticipated amount of time per week dedicated to W3C roles.
  <LI>
    how expenses incurred due to W3C roles (e.g.,
    travel, telephone conference calls, conferences, etc.) will
    be covered.
</UL>
<P>
Individuals must submit this information to the Director for approval and
reference.
<P>
<P>
  <HR>
<H2>
  <A name="Submission">Chapter 4 - Submissions to W3C</A>
</H2>
<P>
W3C encourages its Members, the Team, and the general public to contribute
ideas and specifications that will help W3C achieve its mission.
<P>
Submissions to W3C may be formal or informal and may originate from within
W3C or without.
<P>
Informal submissions (e.g., an email suggesting that someone look into a
certain document) have no formal status and W3C is not required to act on
them or even to respond to them. Submitters have no rights by virtue of having
made a submission. W3C may respond to the submission by creating a public
<A href="#Notes">Note</A>.
<P>
Formal submissions can only be proposed by Members. Work developed jointly
by input from Members and the Team becomes jointly owned and distributable
by the Team as per the Membership Agreement, to allow unfettered publication
of W3C results.
<P>
Formal submission allows the status of work that has not been jointly developed
to be stated and possibly transfer rights to W3C hosts to enable publication
and promote the deployment of the technology.
<P>
A formal submission may result in action by, or creation of, a W3C activity.
The following sections described the formal submissions process.
<H3>
  <A name="SubmissionPackage">4.1 - Submission package</A>
</H3>
<P>
To submit a specification to W3C for review, Members must prepare a submission
package based on the <A href="#ref-submission-overview">submission package
template [PUB13]</A> published at the W3C Web site.
<P>
The submission package must include a complete electronic copy of the
specification being submitted, and must address the following questions:
<UL>
  <LI>
    What organization is submitting the specification? If more than one organization
    is making the submission, all organizations must sign the submission, and
    the answers to these questions must clearly state each organization's position
    on issues raised in the following points.
  <LI>
    What is the submitter's position towards any intellectual property rights
    (IPR) associated with the submission? Any answer (from "we place this in
    the public domain" to "we have a patent on this") is legitimate, but the
    answer will affect the decision as to whether the submission will be acknowledged
    or rejected and whether any effort is put into following it up.

    if the submission is acknowledged by W3C.
</UL>
<P>
The completed submission package must be sent to
<STRONG>submissions@w3.org</STRONG>. It will be forwarded internally to the
appropriate Team members. Note that even if several organizations compose
and sign a submission package, it should only be emailed from one address
with a single cover note signed by each submitter.
<P>
A Member organization submits a specification to W3C through its Advisory
Committee representative. The submission may be withdrawn by the AC
representative at any time. W3C will not make statements about a submission
withdrawn by the submitting AC representative before action has been taken
by the Director.
<P>
W3C will inform submitters that the submission package has been received
no sooner than five days and no later than ten days following reception.
<P>
<STRONG>Under no circumstances may a document be referred to as "submitted
to the World Wide Web Consortium" or "under consideration by W3C" or any
similar phrase, nor should there be any implication made that W3C is working

the submission (as described in section 4.4). </STRONG>

<P>
Once the submission package has been received, the Director
may either acknowledge or reject it. The decision must be made no sooner
than one week after reception of the submission, and no later than two
weeks after reception.
<P>
Until that time, the submission package may not be considered a submission.
The Team may not comment on the submission (to the press, for example).

A submission may be rejected on the following grounds:
<UL>
  <LI>
    The Director feels that the submission is not a good idea, may harm the Web,
    or goes against the principles of W3C.
  <LI>
    Areas addressed by the submission lie outside the scope of W3C's activities.
</UL>
<P>
In case of a rejection, the submitter's Advisory Committee Member will be
notified. The submitter has the right to appeal the decision to the entire

No statements will be made by W3C about the reasons why a submission was
rejected.

    Web site in the public area as a W3C <A href="#Notes">Note</A>, along with
    a statement acknowledging the submission. The acknowledgment statement will
    clearly state that there is no guarantee of any further action based on the
    submission.
  <LI>
    All Advisory Committee Members will be notified of acknowledgment.
  <LI>
    The submitter's Advisory Committee representative will be notified of
    acknowledgment of the submission.
</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>The acknowledgment of a submission does not imply that any action
will be taken by W3C. It does not imply an endorsement by W3C, the W3C Team,
or any of the Members of W3C. It merely records that the submission has been
made by the submitting Member. The specification may not be referred to as
"work in process" of the W3C. </STRONG>
<P>
Once a submission has been acknowledged, several avenues may be open to it:
<UL>
  <LI>
    W3C may express no further interest in the area addressed by the submission.
  <LI>
    Member organizations may express interest in the submission and propose a
    Working Group to develop the specification.
  <LI>
    An existing Working Group may integrate a new work item based on the submission

A W3C Note is a public record of an idea, comment, or document (e.g., a
submission package) submitted by the Team, Members, or the general public.
Encapsulating a document not under W3C's control in a Note allows authors
to refer to a stable, known, and available version of the original document.
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Some external documents may not be available for
re-publication by W3C due to copyright issues, etc. In these cases, it is
not possible to stabilize the document in a Note, so references to the original
document must explicitly identify the exact version. It is not sufficient
to cite the "current draft".

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The "Status of this Document" section may also include a statement about
the purpose of the document where this will help guide the public. There
is no set form for this statement. Examples of statements include:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

changes to the issues addressed may not be made in revisions.
<H3>
  <A name="Recs">5.3 - Recommendations</A>
</H3>
<P>
A Recommendation indicates that <A href="#Consensus">consensus</A> has been
reached among Members about a specific topic and that a specification is
appropriate for widespread use.
<P>
The process described below for creating a Recommendation is an alternative
to, and not a replacement for, or modification of, the standards process
in the W3C Member agreement. In the event that there is a need to revise
a Recommendation, the same process will apply to the creation of the revised
Recommendation.
<P>
The result of the W3C Recommendation process may be submitted to a formal
standards body for ratification, however this is not required or guaranteed.
<H4>
  <A name="RecsWD">5.3.1 - Working Drafts</A>
</H4>
<P>
To initiate the Recommendation process, a Working Group must submit a document
to the Director. The Working Group may either submit its own document or
an external submission (in Note form, with possible modifications) that has
been acknowledged by the Director.
<P>
If the Director approves the Working Group's document, it becomes a
<EM>working draft</EM>. Working drafts may be released publicly or
only to a limited group of reviewers at the Director's
discretion. Publication of a Working Draft does <B>not</B> imply a
commitment to a future proposal as a Recommendation. Every working
draft will be allocated a <A href="#DocumentName">document name</A> to
clearly indicate that the document is a working draft.
<H4>
  <A name="RecsPR">5.3.2 - Proposed Recommendations</A>
</H4>
<P>
Once the Working Group has produced a stable working draft, they may resubmit
it to the Director as a Proposed Recommendation.
<P>
To ensure the proper integration of a Recommendation in the international
community, Proposed Recommendations (and Recommendations) must contain a
statement about how the subject of the Recommendation relates to existing
international standards and to relevant activities being pursued by other
organizations.
<P>
If the Director approves the proposal, the document becomes a
"Proposed Recommendation". A Proposed Recommendation is given a new <A
href="#DocumentName">document name</A> to clearly indicate that the
document is a Proposed Recommendation.


<P>
At this point, an announcement will be made to the Advisory Committee (and
possibly elsewhere, such as in the newsletter) about the release of the Proposed
Recommendation. The announcement must include the following information:
<UL>
  <LI>
    a schedule for anticipated ratification of the proposal
  <LI>
    a deadline for votes from the W3C Membership that is not less than four weeks
    before the anticipated ratification date
  <LI>
    an electronic ballot
  <LI>
    an email address for public comments by the Members
  <LI>
    an email address for confidential comments by the Members
  <LI>
    the name of the specific editor(s) assigned or to be assigned by the Team
  <LI>
    a deadline for editors' replies to substantive comments made by AC
    representatives
  <LI>
    a deadline for the final decision as to the status of the proposal
</UL>
<P>
AC representatives are thus invited to voice their opinions about the proposed
Recommendation by vote.
<H5>
  Votes
</H5>
<P>
Members vote on a Proposed Recommendation by sending their ballot to one
of the addresses given in the proposal announcement before the specified
deadline.
<P>
Public comments may be made available to Members or the public at the discretion
of the proposal's editor. Confidential comments will not be made public by
the Team.
<P>
The proposal's editors must respond to substantive comments until the date
specified in the proposal announcement. During this review period, any Advisory
Committee representative may demand a specific response from the editors
to any public comment made by the representative's Member
organization.
<P>
AC representatives are to return their electronic ballot with one of the
following votes:
<UL>
  <LI>
    Yes
  <LI>
    Yes (with comments)
  <LI>
    No, unless deficiencies are corrected (with comments)
  <LI>
    No, this Proposed Recommendation should be abandoned (with comments)
</UL>
<P>
The voting period lasts at least three weeks.
<H4>
  <A name="RecsW3C">5.3.3 - W3C Recommendations</A>
</H4>
<P>
Once the voting period has ended and all votes
and pertinent comments have been considered, the
Director may elect to do one of the following:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Issue the proposal as a Recommendation.
  <LI>
    Issue the proposal as a Recommendation with minor changes indicated.
  <LI>
    Return the proposal for work at the <A href="#RecsWD">Working Draft</A> stage,
    with a request to the editor to address certain issues.
  <LI>
    Abandon the proposal and remove it from the W3C agenda.
</OL>
<P>
Once a document becomes a W3C Recommendation, it receives a new <A
href="#DocumentName">document name</A> to clearly indicate that it is
a Recommendation.


<P>
Editorial changes may be made to W3C Recommendations after their
release in order, for example, to clarify the document. The date code
will be changed, and the previous version on the Web will be marked as
obsolete.  The Director will notify the Members of such changes.

  <A name="A.2">A.2 - W3C and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</A>
</H3>
<P>
The work of the IETF in places may overlap with the activities of W3C. To
allow clear progress, it is important for the role and domain of operation
of each organization to be well defined and for communication between the
two organizations to be efficient.
<H4>
  Role
</H4>
<P>
The IETF works in an entirely open manner: meetings are generally attended,
by email or physically, by anyone who wishes to participate. W3C, by contrast,
is a Consortium of organizations that pay a Membership fee to support its
operation (membership is open to any organization). W3C has a process for
assigning defined groups of committed experts to solve specific tasks.
<P>
As a result of these differences, IETF working groups tend to be effective
both for the collection of ideas from a wide community, and also, when a
specification exists, for providing criticism from a wide community. W3C
is effective at producing, in a timely manner, a specification that is likely
(though not guaranteed) to meet the needs of its Members and the community.
<H4>
  Domain
</H4>
<P>
The IETF addresses specifically issues of Internet protocols while W3C addresses
the architecture of the Web -- the global information space that is implemented
by using Internet protocols and other tools.
<P>
W3C defines the Web, Web documents, and protocols for their access and
distribution. W3C is the home of the HTML specifications, for which it brings
together expertise in many areas outside the IETF. It also addresses the
questions of intellectual ownership of documents, rating schemes for documents
and the transport of labels (PICS), and in general the metadata that is
information about documents.
<P>
W3C intends not to be involved with the specifications for IP, TCP, or DNS,
for security at any of these levels; with SMTP or NNTP protocols.
<P>
The HTTP protocol has been developed with W3C participation in an IETF context.
This is the area in which IETF experience has been very relevant, and W3C
effort is provided in order to help attain a timely result.
<P>
The URI scheme is the central specification of the Web. Although it is fairly
stable, its extension, where necessary, lies within the scope of W3C activities.
It would be appropriate for W3C to include a new naming scheme developed
by a third party (or the IETF) into the URI specification.
<P>
Every effort must be made for open communication and cooperation between
W3C and the IETF so that, for example, two versions of a specification do
not evolve independently as a result of separate work. Such fragmentation
thwarts the principle of interoperability so vital to W3C success.
<H3>
  <A name="A.3">A.3 - Partnerships</A>
</H3>
<P>
This section summarizes the partnerships (potential or other) for the W3C
with other organizations. A partnership begins with a written agreement between
W3C and some other organization that specifies how the partners will participate
in a given activity.
<P>
Each table entry below addresses the following questions:
<OL>
  <LI>
    What would working with this organization contribute to W3C or the Web? Why
    is this important?
  <LI>
    Is the organization truly interested in working with the W3C? Would W3C have
    to coerce them into participating?
  <LI>
    What is a liaison going to cost (in dollars, staff time, research, travel,
    etc.) and where do these resources come from?
  <LI>
    What expertise can W3C offer?
