<p>This document is the reference description of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. See
the Dublin Core Home Page <a href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">(http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core)</a>
for further information about the workshops, reports, working group papers, projects, and
new developments concerning the Dublin Core metadata element set. </p>

<p>The current list of elements and their general definitions were finalized in December,
1996. The elements and their names are not expected to change substantively from this
list, though the application of some of them is currently experimental and subject to
varying interpretation from implementation to implementation. </p>

<p>Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common semantic
understanding of the element. To promote global interoperability, a number of the element
descriptions may be associated with a controlled vocabulary for the respective element
values. It is assumed that other controlled vocabularies will be developed for
interoperability within certain local domains. In the element descriptions below, a formal
single-word label (shown in italics) is specified to make the syntactic specification of
elements simpler for encoding schemes. Each element is optional and repeatable. </p>

<ol>
  <li><a name="title"></a></li>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>title</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The name given to the resource by the <em>creator</em> or <em>publisher</em>.. </p>
  <li><a name="creator"></a></li>
  <h3>Author or Creator</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>creator</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content
  of the resource. For example, authors in the case of written documents, artists,
  photographers, or illustrators in the case of visual resources.</p>
  <li><a name="subject"></a></li>
  <h3>Subject and Keywords</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>subject</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be expressed as keywords or phrases
  that describe the subject or content of the resource. The use of controlled vocabularies
  and formal classification schemas is encouraged.</p>
  <li><a name="description"></a></li>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>description</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>A textual description of the content of the resource, including abstracts in the case
  of document-like objects or content descriptions in the case of visual resources.</p>
  <li><a name="publisher"></a></li>
  <h3>Publisher</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>publisher</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>The entity responsible for making the resource available in its present form, such as a
  publishing house, a university department, or a corporate entity. </p>
  <li><a name="contributor"></a></li>
  <h3>Other Contributor</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>contributor</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>A person or organization not specified in a <em>creator</em> element who has made
  significant intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary
  to any person or organization specified in a <em>creator</em> element (for example,
  editor, transcriber, and illustrator).</p>
  <li><a name="date"></a></li>
  <h3>Date</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>date</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The date the resource was made available in its present form. Recommended best practice
  is an 8 digit number in the form YYYY-MM-DD as defined in <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>, a
  profile of ISO 8601. In this scheme, the date element 1994-11-05 corresponds to November
  5, 1994. Many other schema are possible, but if used, they should be identified in an
  unambiguous manner.</p>
  <li><a name="type"></a></li>
  <h3>Resource Type</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>type</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working paper, technical
  report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of interoperability, <em>type</em> should be
  selected from an enumerated list that is under development in the workshop series at the
  time of publication of this document. See <a
  href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.html">http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.html
  </a>for current thinking on the application of this element</p>
  <li><a name="format"></a></li>
  <h3>Format</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>format</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The data format of the resource, used to identify the software and possibly hardware
  that might be needed to display or operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability,
  <em>format</em> should be selected from an enumerated list that is under development in
  the workshop series at the time of publication of this document.</p>
  <li><a name="identifier"></a></li>
  <h3>Resource Identifier</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>identifier</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>String or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for networked
  resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers,such
  as International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names would also be
  candidates for this element in the case of off-line resources.</p>
  <li><a name="source"></a></li>
  <h3>Source</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>source</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>A string or number used to uniquely identify the work from which this resource was
  derived, if applicable. For example, a PDF version of a novel might have a <em>source</em>
  element containing an ISBN number for the physical book from which the PDF version was
  derived.</p>
  <li><a name="language"></a></li>
  <h3>Language</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>language</em> <br>
  </p>
  <p>Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource. Where practical, the content
  of this field should coincide with RFC 1766.</p>
  <p>See: <a href="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt</a></p>
  <li><a name="relation"></a></li>
  <h3>Relation</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>relation</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The relationship of this resource to other resources. The intent of this element is to
  provide a means to express relationships among resources that have formal relationships to
  others, but exist as discrete resources themselves. For example, images in a document,
  chapters in a book, or items in a collection. Formal specification of <em>relation</em> is
  currently under development. Users and developers should understand that use of this
  element is currently considered to be experimental.</p>
  <li><a name="coverage"></a></li>
  <h3>Coverage</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>coverage</em><br>
  </p>
  <p>The spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the resource. Formal specification of <em>coverage</em>
  is currently under development. Users and developers should understand that use of this
  element is currently considered to be experimental.</p>
  <li><a name="rights"></a></li>
  <h3>Rights Management</h3>
  <p>Label: <em>rights</em> </p>
  <p>A link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management statement, or to a service that
  would provide information about terms of access to the resource. Formal specification of <em>rights</em>
  is currently under development. Users and developers should understand that use of this
  element is currently considered to be experimental. </p>
