<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This document defines a profile of ISO 8601, the International Standard
for the representation of dates and times. ISO 8601 describes a large number
of date/time formats. To reduce the scope for error and the complexity
of software, it is useful to restrict the supported formats to a small
number. This profile defines a few date/time formats, likely to satisfy
most requirements. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The International Standard for the representation of dates and times
is ISO 8601. Its full reference number is ISO 8601 : 1988 (E), and its
title is &quot;Data elements and interchange formats - Information interchange
- Representation of dates and times&quot;. A <A HREF="http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html">discussion</A>
of ISO 8601 has been written by Markus Kuhn.</P>

<P>ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats. For example
it defines Basic Format, without punctuation, and Extended Format, with
punctuation, and it allows elements to be omitted. To simplify the use
of ISO 8601 in World Wide Web-related standards, and to avoid the need
for the developers and users of these standards to obtain copies of ISO
8601 itself, we define here a range of formats. All these formats are valid
ISO 8601 dates and times.</P>

<P>This profile may be adopted by standards which require an unambiguous
representation of dates and times. As different standards have their own
requirements regarding granularity and flexibility, this profile offers
a number of options. An adopting standard must specify which of these options
it permits.</P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H2>Formats</H2>

<P>Different standards may need different levels of granularity in the
date and time, so this profile defines six levels. Standards that reference
this profile should specify one or more of these granularities. If a given
standard allows more than one granularity, it should specify the meaning
of the dates and times with reduced precision, for example, the result
of comparing two dates with different precisions.</P>

<P>The formats are as follows. Exactly the components shown here must be
present, with exactly this punctuation. Note that the &quot;T&quot; appears
literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element,
as specified in ISO 8601. </P>

<PRE>   Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
    </PRE>

<P>where:</P>

<PRE>     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
    </PRE>

<P>This profile does not specify how many digits may be used to represent
the decimal fraction of a second. An adopting standard that permits fractions
of a second must specify both the minimum number of digits (a number greater
than or equal to one) and the maximum number of digits (the maximum may
be stated to be &quot;unlimited&quot;).</P>

<P>This profile defines two ways of handling time zone offsets:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Times are expressed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), with a special
UTC designator (&quot;Z&quot;). </LI>

<LI>Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset
in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of &quot;+hh:mm&quot; indicates
that the date/time uses a local time zone which is &quot;hh&quot; hours
and &quot;mm&quot; minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of &quot;-hh:mm&quot;
indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is &quot;hh&quot;
hours and &quot;mm&quot; minutes behind UTC. </LI>
</OL>

<P>A standard referencing this profile should permit one or both of these
ways of handling time zone offsets.</P>
