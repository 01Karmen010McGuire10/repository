<p><strong>Relations Working Group </strong></p>

<p>This report is a record of the efforts of the Relations working group constituted
following the Helsinki Metadata Workshop (DC-5) of October, 1997. The recommendations are
provisional and can be expected to evolve in the light of further implementation
experience.</p>

<p>David Bearman, Chair</p>

<p>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is important to indicate the relation between one
information resource and another in metadata for discovery. Because each information
resource may have its own metadata set, these relations need to be explicit.</p>

<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relations are indicated in Dublin Core metadata by the
Relation element. Relation has two sub-elements: Relation.Identifier and Relation.Type.</p>

<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value assigned to Relation.Identifier identifies the
metadata of the related resource or, where this is not possible, the related resource
itself. For more information on the use of this sub-element, see the description of the
Identifier element.</p>

<p>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value assigned to Relation.Type describes the nature of the
relationship between the current resource and the resource identified by
Relation.Identifier. The value of this sub-element is selected from a list of possible
values. The DC community has constructed such a list; this is described below. Other
organisations may construct their own lists, at the cost of interoperability. In due
course, scheme identification will be used to indicate which list of values, and
associated meanings, is being invoked.</p>

<p>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DC list of values for the Relation.Type sub-element
follows.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six pairs of relations are defined at
this time. 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>a) Part/Whole relations are those in which one resource is a physical or logical part
    of another. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>IsPartOf</p>
        <p>HasPart</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>b) Version relations are those in which one resource is an historical state or edition
    of another resource by the same creator. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>IsVersionOf</p>
        <p>HasVersion</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>c) Format transformation relations are those in which one resource has been derived
    from another by a reproduction or reformatting technology which is not fundamentally an
    interpretation but is intended to be a representation. The corresponding values of
    Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>IsFormatOf</p>
        <p>HasFormat</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>d) Reference relations are those in which the author of one resource cites,
    acknowledges, disputes or otherwise refers to another resource. The corresponding values
    of Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>References</p>
        <p>IsReferencedBy</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>e) Creative relations are those in which one resource is a performance, production,
    derivation, translation, adaptation or interpretation of another resource. The
    corresponding values of Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>IsBasedOn</p>
        <p>IsBasisFor</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
    <p>f) Dependency relations are those in which one resource requires another resource for
    its functioning, delivery, or content and cannot be used without the related resource
    being present. The corresponding values of Relation.Type are:<dir>
      <dir>
        <p>Requires</p>
        <p>IsRequiredBy</p>
      </dir>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</dir>

<p>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specialized communities will need to extend the references
relations to express specific types of references or authorial claims.</p>

<p>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Relation element is used in unqualified Dublin
Core metadata, the values of the two sub-elements may be placed directly within the
Relation element. If this is done, recommended best practice is to place first the value
of the Relation.Type sub-element and second the value of the Relation.Identifier
sub-element, separating the two with a space, eg: 

<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>IsBasedOn http://a.b.c/foo.bar</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
</body>
