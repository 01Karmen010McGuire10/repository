    <h1 align = "center">The Dublin Core:<BR>A Simple Content Description Model for Electronic Resources</h1>

    <h3>Metadata for Electronic Resources</h3>

    <P>The Dublin Core is a 15-element metadata element set intended
    to facilitate discovery of electronic resources.  Originally
    conceived for author-generated description of Web resources, it
    has also attracted the attention of formal resource description
    communities such as museums and libraries.

    <P>The Dublin Core Workshop Series has gathered experts from the
    library world, the networking and digital library research
    communities, and a variety of content specialties in a series of
    focussed, invitational workshops.  The building of an
    interdisciplinary, international consensus around a core element
    set is the central feature of the three-year evolution of the
    Dublin Core.  The progress represents the emergent wisdom and
    collective experience of many stakeholders in the resource
    description arena.  An open mailing list supports ongoing work.

    <P>The characteristics of the Dublin Core that distinguish it as a
    prominent candidate for description of electronic resources fall
    into several categories.
      
    <h4>Simplicity</h4>

    <P>The Dublin Core is intended to be usable by non-catalogers as
    well as by those with experience with formal resource description
    models.

    <P>Most of the 15 elements have a commonly understood semantics
    that represents what might be described as aroughly equivalent to
    a catalog card for electronic resources.
      

    <h4>Semantic Interoperability</h4>

    <P>In the Internet Commons, disparate description models interfere
    with the ability to search across discipline boundaries.
    Promoting a commonly understood set of descriptors that helps to
    unify other data content standards increases the possibility of
    semantic interoperability across disciplines.  The Dublin Core is
    the leading candidate as a lingua franca for resource discovery on
    the Internet.

    <h4>International Consensus</h4>

    <P>Recognition of the international scope of resource discovery on the Web
      is critical to the development of effective discovery infrastructure.
      The Dublin Core has benefited from active participation and promotion
      in the United Kingdom, Australia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland,
      Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, Canada, and the United States.

    <h4>Flexibility</h4>

    <P>Although initially motivated by the need for author-generated resource
      description, the Dublin Core includes sufficient flexibility to encode
      the additional structure and more elaborate semantics appropriate to
      more formal resource description applications.

    <h3>Metadata Modularity on the Web</h3>

    <P>The wide diversity of metadata needs on the Web requires an environment
      that supports the coexistence of many independently developed and
      maintained metadata packages.  The Dublin Core is targeted specifically
      towards resource discovery, but other, functionally distinct packages
      will evolve (for example, terms and conditions, archival management,
      administrative metadata, and many others).

    <P>Recognition of the desirability of this sort of modularity has guided
      the evolution of the Dublin Core since the Warwick Workshop, and has
      been formalized as the Warwick Framework.  The concepts articulated in
      this work have informed the ongoing development of a metadata
      architecture for the Web as well.

    <h4>A Metadata Architecture for the Web</h4>

    The <A HREF = "http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</A> (W3C)
    is the primary standards forum for the Web, and has recently begun to
    focus on implementing an architecture for metadata for the Web.  The
    <A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/Metadata/RDF">Resource Description
      Framework</A>, or RDF, is evolving to support the many different
    metadata needs of vendors and information providers.  Representatives
    of the Dublin Core effort are actively involved in the development of
    this architecture, bringing the digital library perspective to bear on
    this important component of the Web infrastructure.
