    <P>
      This document is the reference description of the Dublin Core
      Metadata Element Set.  See the Dublin Core Home Page <A
      HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">
      (http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core)</A> for further
      information about the workshops, reports, working group papers,
      projects, and new developments concerning the Dublin Core
      metadata element set.
    </p>

    <P>
      The current list of elements and their general definitions were
      finalized in December, 1996.  The elements and their names are not
      expected to change substantively from this list, though the
      application of some of them is currently experimental and subject to
      varying interpretation from implementation to implementation. </p>

    <P>
      Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common
      semantic understanding of the element.  To promote global
      interoperability, a number of the element descriptions may be
      associated with a controlled vocabulary for the respective element
      values.  It is assumed that other controlled vocabularies will be
      developed for interoperability within certain local domains.  In the
      element descriptions below, a formal single-word label is specified 
      to make the syntactic specification of elements simpler for encoding
      schemes.  Each element is optional and repeatable.
      Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common
      semantic understanding of the element.  In addition, a formal,
      single-word label (expressed in the following list in all upper case)
      is specified to make syntactic specification of elements simpler in
      encoding schemes.</p>

    <P>

	  <BR>

	<P> The person or organization primarily responsible for creating
	  the intellectual content of the resource.  For example, authors
	  in the case of written documents, artists, photographers, or
	  illustrators in the case of visual resources.</P>

      <LI><A NAME = "subject"><H3>Subject and Keywords</H3></A> Label: 
	SUBJECT <BR>

	<P> The topic of the resource.  Typically, subject will be
	  expressed as keywords or phrases that describe the subject or
	  content of the resource.  The use of controlled vocabularies 
	  and formal classification schemas is encouraged.</P>

	
      <LI><A NAME = "description"><H3>Description</H3></A> Label: 
	DESCRIPTION <BR>

	<P> A textual description of the content of the resource, 
	  including abstracts in the case of document-like objects or
	  content descriptions in the case of visual resources.</P>
	
      <LI><A NAME = "publisher"> <H3>Publisher</H3></A> Label: PUBLISHER 
	<BR>

	<P> The entity responsible for making the resource available in
	  its present form, such as a publishing house, a university
	  department, or a corporate entity. </P>
	
      <LI><A NAME = "contributor"> <H3>Other Contributor</H3></A> Label:
	CONTRIBUTOR <BR>

	<P> A person or organization not specified in a CREATOR element
	  who has made significant intellectual contributions to the
	  resource but whose contribution is secondary to any person or
	  organization specified in a CREATOR element (for example, editor,
	  transcriber, and illustrator).</P>



      <LI><A NAME = "date"> <H3>Date</H3> </A> 	Label: DATE <BR>

	<p> The date the resource was made available in its present 
	  form.  Recommended best practice is an 8 digit number in the form
	  YYYY-MM-DD as defined in <A
	    href="http://purl.org/metadata/dc/8601-date-profile">
	    http://purl.org/metadata/dc/8601-date-profile</A>, a profile of
	  ISO 8601.  In this scheme, the date element 1994-11-05
	  corresponds to November 5, 1994.  Many other schema are possible,
	  but if used, they should be identified in an unambiguous
	  manner.</P>
	
      <LI><A NAME = "type"><H3>Resource Type</H3> </A> Label: TYPE <BR>

	<P> The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, 
	  poem, working paper, technical report, essay, dictionary.  For
	  the sake of interoperability, TYPE should be selected from an
	  enumerated list that is under development in the workshop series
	  at the time of publication of this document.  See <A
	    href="http://purl.org/metadata/dc/resource-type">
	    http://purl.org/metadata/dc/resource-type </A> for current
	  thinking on the application of this element</P>

      <LI><A NAME = "format"><H3>Format</H3> </A> Label: FORMAT <BR>

	<P> The data format of the resource, used to identify the
	  software and possibly hardware that might be needed to display
	  or operate the resource.  For the sake of interoperability,
	  FORMAT should be selected from an enumerated list that is under
	  development in the workshop series at the time of publication of
	  this document.</p>
	
      <LI><A NAME = "identifier"><H3>Resource Identifier</H3> </A> Label: 
	IDENTIFIER <BR>

	<P> String or number used to uniquely identify the resource. 
	  Examples for networked resources include URLs and URNs (when
	  implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers,such as
	  International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names
	  would also be candidates for this element in the case of
	  off-line resources.</P>

      <LI><A NAME = "source"><H3>Source</H3> </A>	Label: SOURCE <BR>

	<P> A string or number used to uniquely identify the work from 
	  which this resource was derived, if applicable.  For example, a
	  PDF version of a novel might have a SOURCE element containing an
	  ISBN number for the physical book from which the PDF version was
	  derived.</p>


      <LI><A NAME = "language"><H3>Language</H3> </A>	Label: LANGUAGE 
	<BR>

	<P> Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource.
	  Where practical, the content of this field should coincide with
	  the NISO Z39.53 three character codes for written languages. </P>

	<P>
	  See: <a href="http://www.sil.org/sgml/nisoLang3-1994.html">

      <LI><A NAME = "relation"><H3>Relation</H3> 	Label: RELATION <BR>

	<P> The relationship of this resource to other resources.  The
	  intent of this element is to provide a means to express
	  relationships among resources that have formal relationships to
	  others, but exist as discrete resources themselves.  For example,
	  images in a document, chapters in a book, or items in a
	  collection.  Formal specification of RELATION is currently
	  under development.  Users and developers should understand that
	  use of this element is currently considered to be
	  experimental.</p>

      <LI><A NAME = "coverage"> <H3>Coverage</H3> </A> Label: COVERAGE 
	<BR>
	<P> The spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the resource.
	  Formal specification of COVERAGE is currently under development.
	  Users and developers should understand that use of this element

      <LI><A NAME = "rights"> <H3>Rights Management</H3> </A> Label: RIGHTS

	<P> A link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management
	  statement, or to a service that would provide information about
