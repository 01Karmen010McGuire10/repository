<h2 align="center"><strong>Rights Management Element Working Group</strong></h2>

<hr>

<p>Moderator: Carl Lagoze&nbsp; (<a href="mailto:lagoze@cs.cornell.edu">lagoze@cs.cornell.edu</a>)</p>

<p>I have volunteered to lead a rights management element working group.&nbsp; While I'm
happy to host such a discussion, I should state that I am extremely prejudiced that more
than minimal handling of the rights management issue is out-of-scope for the Dublin Core.
&nbsp; A look at the standing definition for the element states that it is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;A link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management statement, or to a service
  that would provide information about terms of access to the resource.&nbsp; Formal
  specification of rights is currently under development.&nbsp; Users and developers should
  understand that use of this element is currently considered to be experimental.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working with John Kunze on RFC 1, I'm suggesting a change to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;A free text explanation pertaining to the terms of access to the resource, or a
  link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management statement, or to a service that would
  provide information about terms of access to the resource.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This eliminates the implication in the old definition that the specification of the
rights management element might attempt some taxonomy of rights management.&nbsp; In my
humble opinion, this is hopeless - rights management is simply too complex.</p>

<p>Now that I've opened up the discussion, I'm happy to take requests from anyone wanting
to join this group.</p>
