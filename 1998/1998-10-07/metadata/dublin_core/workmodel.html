<p>Following some very interesting late-night round-table conversations in the Grand
Marina's bar re DC and RDF, we concluded that all is not well with the DC Data Model.
&nbsp; Not to put too fine a point on it, there ain't one.&nbsp; This has led to some
confusion and some contortions, which have been no more that a nuisance in the HTML world,
but would, if left untreated, prevent us from making good use of the New World of RDF.</p>

<p>The questions that have been asked include: 

<ol>
  <li>Will it be possible to automatically convert qualified DC metadata from HTML to RDF?</li>
  <li>Are some of the &quot;sub-elements&quot; currently in use not sub-elements at all, but
    rater names with lots of dots in them? How will these impact point 1 above?</li>
  <li>Are lang and scheme&nbsp; simply generic sub-elements for which we've invented a
    convenient HTML notation?&nbsp; How do they map to RDF?</li>
  <li>Why are important groups (e.g. AHDS and the museum community) having to play creative
    tricks with elements like DC.Creator, DC.Contributor, DC.Publisher?&nbsp; How will these
    impact point 1 above?</li>
</ol>

<p>The DC Data Model working group was set up at Helsinki to discuss these and similar
questions.&nbsp; The group aims to: 

<ul>
  <li>develop a Data Model for both unqualified and qualified Dublin Core metadata,</li>
  <li>consider the mapping of both unqualified and qualified Dublin Core metadata to RDF,</li>
  <li>make recommendations for the development of Dublin Core metadata, consistent with the
    automated conversion of such metadata from HTML to RDF.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the questions span quite a broad area, the Data Model working group will work
closely with other working groups, including the Sub-Elements working group, the
Relation.Type working group, and others.</p>

<p>At DC-5, I agreed to chair the Data Model working group and would welcome your
participation.</p>

<p>Paul Miller has kindly offered to set up the dc-datamodel discussion list on the
Mailbase service.&nbsp; If you want to join it, please drop him a line at Paul Miller (<a
