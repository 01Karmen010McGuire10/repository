<p>Moderator: David Bearman (<a href="mailto:dbear@archimuse.com">dbear@archimuse.com</a>)</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>The Helsinki meeting of the Dublin core working group agreed that there was a one to
one relation between a metadata set and an information resource.&nbsp; Thus, if the
metadata we are creating describes a digital object whose source was a photograph which in
turn has as its source an original manuscript, there will be three metadata sets (each
consisting of as many as all fifteen repeatable Dublin Core elements).&nbsp; Obviously we
need to define the nature of the relation between these metadata sets (sometimes these
will be in the same &quot;record&quot; and other times they will have been created by
different people at different times).</p>

<p>Initial work on defining a scheme of values for Relation.Type took place in Helsinki.
&nbsp; A group of about half the participants (30) met for an hour to define such types
and enumerated many relationships which they initially clustered into five categories of
relations.&nbsp; It defined these as creative, mechanical, versions, inclusion and
reference, but acknowledged that this was a very preliminary scheme.</p>

<p>In informal discussions immediately following the meeting, a slightly more complete
model emerged when more examples were introduced:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Historical<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Creative (such as translations, performances)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanical (such as reproductions, format transformations,
  copies, mirrors)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Versions (such as published editions, drafts, plans, print
  states)</p>
  <p><strong>Part/Whole<br>
  </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclusions (such as physical collections, items, parts)</p>
  <p><strong>References<br>
  </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Citations (such as bibliographic citations,
  acknowledgements)</p>
  <p><strong>Dependency<br>
  </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical (Software or hardware dependency)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideotypical (specimen to Type-specimen, work to iconographic
  type)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one expects to develop a typology that will be fixed (all discussion was in terms of
an extensible list), but the need for a reasonably complete typology is pressing for
implementers.&nbsp; This is a call to all those who wish to contribute grist to that
discussion to offer examples of relationships which you feel must be accommodated. &nbsp;
We have found that examples are very helpful in describing the relationships since we come
from quite different communities.&nbsp; This call will be open until November 15, 1997.</p>

<p>We will aim to report formally in time for inclusion in the report of the Helsinki
conference, which is expected to be submitted in final form before the end of December.</p>
