<p><strong>Description of Dublin Core Elements</strong> </p>

<p>The following is the reference definition of the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. The
evolving reference description, including any defined <font face="Times New Roman">qualifiers,
resides at <a href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core</a></font>
&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the element descriptions below, each element has a descriptive name intended to
convey a common semantic understanding of the element, as well as a formal single-word
label intended to make the syntactic specification of elements simpler for encoding
schemes. &nbsp; </p>

<p>Although some environments, such as HTML, are not case-sensitive, it is recommended
best practice always to adhere to the case conventions in the element labels given below
to avoid conflicts in the event that the metadata is subsequently extracted or converted
to a case-sensitive environment, such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml">http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml</a> &nbsp; </p>

<p>Each element is optional and repeatable. Furthermore, metadata elements may appear in
any order, and with no significance being attached to that order. &nbsp; </p>

<p>To promote global interoperability, a number of the element descriptions suggest a
controlled vocabulary for the respective element values. It is assumed that other
controlled vocabularies will be developed for interoperability within certain local
domains. &nbsp; </p>

<p>A metadata element's meaning is unaffected by whether or not the element is embedded in
the resource that it describes. &nbsp; </p>

<p>The metadata elements fall into three groups which roughly indicate the class or scope
of information stored in them: (1) elements related mainly to the Content of the resource,
(2) elements related mainly to the resource when viewed as Intellectual Property, and (3)
elements related mainly to the Instantiation of the resource. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Title&quot; </p>

<p>The name given to the resource, usually by the Creator or Publisher. &nbsp; </p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Author or Creator&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label:
&quot;Creator&quot; </p>

<p>The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content
of the resource. For example, authors in the case of written documents, artists,
photographers, or illustrators in the case of visual resources. &nbsp; </p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject and Keywords&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label:
&quot;Subject&quot; </p>

<p>The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be expressed as keywords or phrases
that describe the subject or content of the resource. The use of controlled vocabularies
and formal classification schemes is encouraged. &nbsp; </p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Description&quot;
</p>

<p>A textual description of the content of the resource, including abstracts in the case
of document-like objects or content descriptions in the case of visual resources. &nbsp; </p>

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Publisher&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Publisher&quot; </p>

<p>The entity responsible for making the resource available in its present form, such as a
publishing house, a university department, or a corporate entity. &nbsp; </p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Contributor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label:
&quot;Contributor&quot; </p>

<p>A person or organization not specified in a Creator element who has made significant
intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary to any
person or organization specified in a Creator element (for example, editor, transcriber,
and illustrator). &nbsp;</p>

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Date&quot; </p>

<p>A date associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Such a date is not
to be confused with one belonging in the Coverage element, which would be associated with
the resource only insofar as the intellectual content is somehow about that date.
Recommended best practice is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [Date and Time Formats
(based on ISO8601), W3C Technical Note, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>]
that includes (among others) dates of the forms YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD. In this scheme, for
example, the date 1994-11-05 corresponds to November 5, 1994. &nbsp; </p>

<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resource Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Type&quot; </p>

<p>The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working paper, technical
report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of interoperability, Type should be selected from
an enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop series. &nbsp; </p>

<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Format&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Format&quot; </p>

<p>The data format of the resource, used to identify the software and possibly hardware
that might be needed to display or operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability,
Format should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under development in
the workshop series. &nbsp; </p>

<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resource Identifier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label:
&quot;Identifier&quot; </p>

<p>A string or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for networked
resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers,
such as International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names are also
candidates for this element. &nbsp; </p>

<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; Source&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Source&quot; </p>

<p>Information about a second resource from which the present resource is derived. While
it is generally recommended that elements contain information about the present resource
only, this element may contain a date, creator, format, identifier, or other metadata for
the second resource when it is considered important for discovery of the present resource;
recommended best practice is to use the Relation element instead. For example, it is
possible to use a Source date of 1603 in a description of a 1996 film adaptation of a
Shakespearean play, but it is preferred instead to use Relation &quot;IsBasedOn&quot; with
a reference to a separate resource whose description contains a Date of 1603. Source is
not applicable if the present resource is in its original form. &nbsp; </p>

<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Language&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Language&quot; </p>

<p>The language of the intellectual content of the resource. Where practical, the content
of this field should coincide with RFC 1766 [Tags for the Identification of Languages, <a
href="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt</a>
]; examples include en, de, es, fi, fr, ja, th, and zh. &nbsp; </p>

<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Relation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Relation&quot; </p>

<p>An identifier of a second resource and its relationship to the present resource. This
element permits links between related resources and resource descriptions to be indicated.
Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf), a translation of a work (IsBasedOn),
a chapter of a book (IsPartOf), and a mechanical transformation of a dataset into an image
(IsFormatOf). For the sake of interoperability, relationships should be selected from an
enumerated list that is currently under development in the workshop series. &nbsp; </p>

<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coverage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label: &quot;Coverage&quot; </p>

<p>The spatial or temporal characteristics of the intellectual content of the resource.
Spatial coverage refers to a physical region (e.g., celestial sector); use coordinates
(e.g., longitude and latitude) or place names that are from a controlled list or are fully
spelled out. Temporal coverage refers to what the resource is about rather than when it
was created or made available (the latter belonging in the Date element); use the same
date/time format (often a range) [Date and Time Formats (based on ISO8601), W3C Technical
Note, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>]
as recommended for the Date element or time periods that are from a controlled list or are
fully spelled out. &nbsp; </p>

<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rights Management&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Label:
&quot;Rights&quot; </p>

<p>A rights management statement, an identifier that links to a rights management
statement, or an identifier that links to a service providing information about rights
management for the resource. <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp; </font></p>
