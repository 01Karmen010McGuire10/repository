<p>Date Ranges and DC.Date Subelement Definitions</strong> </p>

<p>This report is a record of the efforts of the Date working group constituted following
the Helsinki Dublin Core Metadata Workshop (DC-5) of October, 1997. The recommendations
are provisional and can be expected to evolve in the light of further implementation
experience. &nbsp; </p>

<p><strong>Date Ranges</strong></p>

<p>It is proposed that Date ranges be specified using a subset of the ISO 8601
&quot;period of time&quot; specification as restricted to dates conformant with the W3C
technical note specification (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>).
A typical range is given as start and end dates separated by a '/' (slash) character.
Either the start or end date may be missing. </p>

<p>Examples include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1992/1997 # starts in 1992 and ends in 1997 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1998-01-05T08:15/1998-01-05T13:15 # a range of 5 hours in early 1998 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1948/ # from 1948 (no end specified) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /1989 # until 1989 (no start specified) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that no consensus on this range format was reached.</p>

<p><strong>DC.Date Subelements</strong> </p>

<p>Used without a subelement designation (i.e., unqualified), a DC.Date element contains a
date associated with the creation or availability of the resource. All DC.Date subelements
are consistent with this definition, but allow increased precision. They are intended for
those collections (e.g., libraries and archives) and searchers for whom the benefit to
discovery may justify the extra cost in metadata creation and maintenance. </p>

<p>These subelements may be seen as falling into the three groups below, with DC.Created
and DC.Issued providing perhaps the most commonly required extra precision. Different
syntaxes for specifying subelements exist; the abstract subelement notation below is not a
valid syntax. </p>

</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. DC.Date-&gt;Created </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of creation of the resource. </p>

<p>When DC.Date is insufficiently precise, use this subelement to distinguish a date that
identifies just the creation of the present resource. Examples include the date that an
article was written, a photograph taken, a piece of music composed, or a performance
recorded. An HTML file created in 1997 as a transcription of an article written in 1875
could have both </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Created: 1997 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Source-&gt;Date-&gt;Created: 1875 </p>

<p>Alternatively, a simpler description could include exactly one date as either </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date: 1997 </p>

<p>or, depending on the metadata provider's preference, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date: 1875 </p>

<p>If you wished to describe different versions of a resource with one resource
description, it would be appropriate to put the creation date of the latest version in
DC.Date-&gt;Created. On the other hand, you might instead choose to describe each version
with a separate resource description. &nbsp; </p>

<p>2. DC.Date-&gt;Issued </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of formal issuance (e.g., publication) of the resource. </p>

<p>When DC.Date is insufficiently precise, use this subelement to distinguish a release
date that has recognized legal (e.g., copyright) or institutional (e.g., posting of a
staff policy change) significance. For example, the description of a work published
posthumously might have just &quot;DC.Date: 1997&quot;, just &quot;DC.Date: 1948&quot;, or
both </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Issued: 1997 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Created: 1948 </p>

<p>A government file, officially released in 1997, consisting of photographs taken in 1985
of hundreds of meteorite fragments collected in 1952 could be described with the following
metadata: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Issued: 1997 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Created: 1985 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;DataGathered: 1952 &nbsp; </p>

<p>3. DC.Date-&gt;Accepted </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of acceptance (e.g., dissertation or treaty) of the resource. </p>

<p>When DC.Date and DC.Date-&gt;Issued are insufficiently precise, use this subelement to
indicate when the resource was formally adopted by a party that accepts or vouches for it.
&nbsp; </p>

<p>4. DC.Date-&gt;Available</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date (often a range) that the resource will become or did become
available. </p>

<p>When DC.Date and DC.Date-&gt;Issued are insufficiently precise, use this subelement to
indicate a start, end, or both start and end of a period during which access to the
resource was or will be granted. It may be needed to indicate an availability period that
will start or end in the future, or did come to an end in the past. For example, a journal
collection ranging from 1955 to 1996 may be given as </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Available: 1955/1996 &nbsp; </p>

<p>5. DC.Date-&gt;Acquired </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of acquistion or accession. </p>

<p>When DC.Date and DC.Date-&gt;Issued are insufficiently precise, use this subelement to
distinguish the time that a resource was acquired or accessioned in the context of a
collection to which it belongs or in which it resides. For example, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Title: Treaty of 1645 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Issued: 1645 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Accepted: 1646 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Acquired: 1958 &nbsp; </p>

<p>6. DC.Date-&gt;DataGathered</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date of sampling of the information in the resource. </p>

<p>When DC.Date and DC.Date-&gt;Created are insufficiently precise, use this subelement to
distinguish the time of raw data creation as opposed to resource content (e.g.,
intellectual content) creation, which belongs in DC.Date-&gt;Created. Examples include the
date that a group of weather stations were sampled and a range of times during which
radiation measurements were taken. To identify the date when a photograph was taken,
DC.Date-&gt;Created is recommended. &nbsp; </p>

<p>7. DC.Date-&gt;Valid </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date (often a range) of validity of the resource. </p>

<p>When DC.Date and DC.Date-&gt;Issued are insufficiently precise, use this subelement to
indicate when the resource content may be considered to hold true. In a somewhat labored
example, suppose a public transit system is in the practice of creating a new bus
schedule, allowing two weeks for issuance of a print run, allowing two more weeks for
printed copies of the schedule to be placed in distribution racks, and finally being
required to do so at least one month in advance of drivers switching the timing on their
routes. Metadata for such a bus schedule might include all of the following elements: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Description: City Bus Schedule <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Created: 1997-11-01 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Issued: 1997-11-15 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Available: 1997-12-01/1998-06-01 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DC.Date-&gt;Valid: 1998-01-01/1998-06-01 &nbsp; </p>
