Reference Description </H2>

<P>This document is the reference description of the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set. See the Dublin Core Home Page <A HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core">(http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core)</A>
for further information about the workshops, reports, working group papers,
projects, and new developments concerning the Dublin Core metadata element
set. </P>

<P>The current list of elements and their general definitions were finalized
in December, 1996. The elements and their names are not expected to change
substantively from this list, though the application of some of them is
currently experimental and subject to varying interpretation from implementation
to implementation. </P>

<P>Note that elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common
semantic understanding of the element. To promote global interoperability,
a number of the element descriptions may be associated with a controlled
vocabulary for the respective element values. It is assumed that other
controlled vocabularies will be developed for interoperability within certain
local domains. In the element descriptions below, a formal single-word
label is specified to make the syntactic specification of elements simpler
for encoding schemes. Each element is optional and repeatable. Note that
elements have a descriptive name intended to convey a common semantic understanding
of the element. In addition, a formal, single-word label (expressed in
the following list in all upper case) is specified to make syntactic specification
of elements simpler in encoding schemes.</P>

<H3>Author or Creator</H3>

<P>Label: CREATOR <BR>
</P>

<P>The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual
content of the resource. For example, authors in the case of written documents,

<LI><A NAME="subject"></A></LI>

<H3>Subject and Keywords</H3>

<P>Label: SUBJECT <BR>
</P>

<P>The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be expressed as keywords

of controlled vocabularies and formal classification schemas is encouraged.</P>

<LI><A NAME="description"></A></LI>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P>Label: DESCRIPTION <BR>
</P>

<P>A textual description of the content of the resource, including abstracts
in the case of document-like objects or content descriptions in the case
of visual resources.</P>

<LI><A NAME="publisher"></A></LI>

<H3>Publisher</H3>

<P>Label: PUBLISHER <BR>
</P>

<P>The entity responsible for making the resource available in its present
form, such as a publishing house, a university department, or a corporate
entity. </P>

<LI><A NAME="contributor"></A></LI>

<H3>Other Contributor</H3>

<P>Label: CONTRIBUTOR <BR>
</P>

<P>A person or organization not specified in a CREATOR element who has
made significant intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution
is secondary to any person or organization specified in a CREATOR element
(for example, editor, transcriber, and illustrator).</P>

<LI><A NAME="date"></A></LI>

<H3>Date</H3>

<P>Label: DATE <BR>
</P>

<P>The date the resource was made available in its present form. Recommended
best practice is an 8 digit number in the form YYYY-MM-DD as defined in
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915.html</A><A HREF="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core/iso8601.html">.</A>,
a profile of ISO 8601. In this scheme, the date element 1994-11-05 corresponds
to November 5, 1994. Many other schema are possible, but if used, they
should be identified in an unambiguous manner.</P>

<LI><A NAME="type"></A></LI>

<H3>Resource Type</H3>

<P>Label: TYPE <BR>
</P>

<P>The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working
paper, technical report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of interoperability,
TYPE should be selected from an enumerated list that is under development
in the workshop series at the time of publication of this document. See
<A HREF="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.html">http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Metadata/types.html
</A>for current thinking on the application of this element</P>

<LI><A NAME="format"></A></LI>

<H3>Format</H3>

<P>Label: FORMAT <BR>
</P>

<P>The data format of the resource, used to identify the software and possibly
hardware that might be needed to display or operate the resource. For the
sake of interoperability, FORMAT should be selected from an enumerated
list that is under development in the workshop series at the time of publication
of this document.</P>

<LI><A NAME="identifier"></A></LI>

<H3>Resource Identifier</H3>

<P>Label: IDENTIFIER <BR>
</P>

<P>String or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for
networked resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other globally-unique
identifiers,such as International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other
formal names would also be candidates for this element in the case of off-line
resources.</P>

<LI><A NAME="source"></A></LI>

<H3>Source</H3>

<P>Label: SOURCE <BR>
</P>

<P>A string or number used to uniquely identify the work from which this
resource was derived, if applicable. For example, a PDF version of a novel
might have a SOURCE element containing an ISBN number for the physical
book from which the PDF version was derived.</P>

<LI><A NAME="language"></A></LI>

<H3>Language</H3>

<P>Label: LANGUAGE <BR>
</P>

codes for written languages. </P>

</A></P>

<LI><A NAME="relation"></A></LI>

<H3>Relation</H3>

<P>Label: RELATION <BR>
</P>

<P>The relationship of this resource to other resources. The intent of
this element is to provide a means to express relationships among resources
that have formal relationships to others, but exist as discrete resources
themselves. For example, images in a document, chapters in a book, or items
in a collection. Formal specification of RELATION is currently under development.
Users and developers should understand that use of this element is currently
considered to be experimental.</P>

<LI><A NAME="coverage"></A></LI>

<H3>Coverage</H3>

<P>Label: COVERAGE <BR>
</P>

<P>The spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the resource. Formal
specification of COVERAGE is currently under development. Users and developers
should understand that use of this element is currently considered to be
experimental.</P>

<LI><A NAME="rights"></A></LI>

<H3>Rights Management</H3>

<P>Label: RIGHTS </P>

<P>A link to a copyright notice, to a rights-management statement, or to
a service that would provide information about terms of access to the resource.
Formal specification of RIGHTS is currently under development. Users and
