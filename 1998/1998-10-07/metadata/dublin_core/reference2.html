<h2>Element Descriptions</h2>

<ol>
  <li><a name="title"></a></li>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Title&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The name given to the resource by the Creator or Publisher.</p>
  <li><a name="creator"></a></li>
  <h3>Author or Creator</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Creator&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content
  of the resource. For example, authors in the case of written documents, artists,
  photographers, or illustrators in the case of visual resources.</p>
  <li><a name="subject"></a></li>
  <h3>Subject and Keywords</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Subject&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The topic of the resource. Typically, subject will be expressed as keywords or phrases
  that describe the subject or content of the resource. The use of controlled vocabularies
  and formal classification schemas is encouraged.</p>
  <li><a name="description"></a></li>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Description&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>A textual description of the content of the resource, including abstracts in the case
  of document-like objects or content descriptions in the case of visual resources.</p>
  <li><a name="publisher"></a></li>
  <h3>Publisher</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Publisher&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The entity responsible for making the resource available in its present form, such as a
  publishing house, a university department, or a corporate entity. </p>
  <li><a name="contributor"></a></li>
  <h3>Other Contributor</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Contributor&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>A person or organization not specified in a Creator element who has made significant
  intellectual contributions to the resource but whose contribution is secondary to any
  person or organization specified in a Creator element (for example, editor, transcriber,
  and illustrator).</p>
  <li><a name="date"></a></li>
  <h3>Date</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Date&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>A date associated with the creation or availability of the resource.&nbsp; Such a date
  is not to be confused with one belonging in the Coverage element, which would be
  associated with the resource only insofar as the intellectual content is somehow about
  that date.&nbsp; Recommended best practice is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 (W3C
  Technical Note, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime</a>)
  that includes (among others) dates of the forms YYYY and YYYY-MM-DD.&nbsp; In this scheme,
  for example, the date 1994-11-05 corresponds to November 5, 1994.</p>
  <li><a name="type"></a></li>
  <h3>Resource Type</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Type&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The category of the resource, such as home page, novel, poem, working paper, technical
  report, essay, dictionary. For the sake of interoperability, Type should be selected from
  an enumerated list that is under development in the workshop series.&nbsp; </p>
  <li><a name="format"></a></li>
  <h3>Format</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Format&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The data format of the resource, used to identify the software and possibly hardware
  that might be needed to display or operate the resource. For the sake of interoperability,
  Format should be selected from an enumerated list that is currently under development in
  the workshop series.&nbsp; </p>
  <li><a name="identifier"></a></li>
  <h3>Resource Identifier</h3>
  <p>Label: &quot;Identifier&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>A string or number used to uniquely identify the resource. Examples for networked
  resources include URLs and URNs (when implemented). Other globally-unique identifiers,
  such as International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) or other formal names are also
  candidates for this element.&nbsp; </p>
  <li><a name="source"></a></li>
  <h3>Source</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Source&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>Information about a second resource from which the present resource is derived. &nbsp;
  While it is generally recommended that elements contain information about the present
  resource only, this element may contain a date, creator, format, identifier, or other
  metadata for the second resource; recommended best practice is to use the Relation element
  instead.&nbsp; For example, it is possible to use a Source date of 1603 in a description
  of a 1996 film adaptation of a Shakespearean play, but it is preferred instead to use
  Relation &quot;IsBasedOn&quot; with a reference to a separate resource whose description
  contains a Date of 1603.&nbsp; Source is not applicable if the present resource is in its
  original form.</p>
  <li><a name="language"></a></li>
  <h3>Language</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Language&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The language of the intellectual content of the resource.&nbsp; Where practical, the
  content of this field should coincide with RFC 1766 (Tags for the Identification of
  Languages, <a href="http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt">http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1766.txt</a>);
  examples include en, de, es, fi, fr, ja, th, and zh.</p>
  <li><a name="relation"></a></li>
  <h3>Relation</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Relation&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>An identifier of a second resource and its relationship to the present resource. &nbsp;
  This element permits links between related resources (e.g., ancestors) and resource
  descriptions to be indicated.&nbsp; Examples include an edition of a work (IsVersionOf)a
  translation of a work (IsBasedOn), a chapter of a book (IsPartOf), or a mechanical
  transformation of a dataset into an image (IsFormatOf).&nbsp; For the sake of
  interoperability, relationships should be selected from an enumerated list that is
  currently under development in the workshop series.</p>
  <li><a name="coverage"></a></li>
  <h3>Coverage</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Coverage&quot;<br>
  </p>
  <p>The spatial and/or temporal characteristics of the intellectual content of the
  resource.&nbsp; Any date in this element is concerned with what the resource is about
  rather than when it was created or made available, the latter belonging in the Date
  element.&nbsp; Formal specification of Coverage is currently under development.</p>
  <li><a name="rights"></a></li>
  <h3>Rights Management</h3>
  <p>Label:&nbsp; &quot;Rights&quot;</p>
  <p>A rights management statement, or identifier that links to a rights management
  statement, or an identifier that links to a service providing information about rights
  management for the resource.</p>
