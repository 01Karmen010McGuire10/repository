2010-09-09 (Tom): While looking for the earliest reference to
"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/", I came across a reference
to the namespace in the body of the August 2000 text of [1]
-- a preprint of the October 2000 D-Lib Magazine article,
"A Grammar of Dublin Core" [2].

This article cited [3] -- DCMES Version 1.1 -- which does not
mention "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" in the body of the
text, but uses the URI in an RDF element embedded in the HTML, which becomes visible
when viewing the source [3].  This RDF element was lost when
this document was reformatted with the modern DCMI style [4].

The previous version of DCMES [5] had an embedded RDF element
as well, but bound the prefix dc: to itself (the containing
document), not to a PURL.

In my recollection, a namespace URI had been decided at a Data
Model meeting in Crete in September 1998. This recollection
was reinforced by a reference in a talk Eric Miller gave at
DC6 in November 1998 [6] to decisions taken [7], among which
to create a "DC namespace" for defining the core elements,
"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/".

Mailbase is long gone, but I found "decisions.html" in my own
archive (appended as text below, to appear as [8] at the next
build of the DCMI Website).

In short, it appears to me:

-- It was decided in September 1998 to coin the DC namespace
   "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/", but that namespace was 
   never used.

-- When DCMES Version 1.1 was published in July 1999, the
   namespace "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" was used to create
   URIs for the fifteen elements, though these URIs were hidden from
   view in an embedded RDF element.

-- RDF schemas for DCMES were created as early as 1997
   [9,10,11], but it wasn't until March 2000 [12] that
   the (published) schemas used the namespace URI
   "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/".
