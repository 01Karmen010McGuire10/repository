<h2>Overview of the DCMI Web site (http://dublincore.org)</h2>
<p>All of the pages on the website have server-side includes for the header and 
the footer. The home page has a bolder and bigger style of header and footer, 
but other than that, everything remains the same throughout the entire site. Pages 
that get the server side includes have the .shtml file suffix. Other files on 
the site that do not get server side includes (like PowerPoint presentations) 
should have the .html or .htm file suffix. </p>
<p>Below this <a href="#home">Home Page</a> is the first level of information. 
</p>
<p>These areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#about">About the Initiative</a></li>
<li><a href="#news">DCMI News</a></li>
<li><a href="#documents">Documents</a></li>
<li><a href="#groups">Groups</a></li>
<li><a href="#meetings">Meetings and Presentations</a></li>
<li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#tools">Tools &amp; Software</a></li>
<li><a href="#workshops">Workshops</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these pages have a left-hand column for navigation and a right-hand 
column for content. Depending on the type of information that was being presented, 
there are 2 different structures for these pages. For content that is relatively 
static, the right content column contains brief descriptions of the content that 
is available further down into the site. The intent is to give the user a quick 
intro to what would be available if they clicked on the &quot;more info...&quot; 
link.</p>
<p>Pages that have this structure include: About the Initiative and Resources. 
The Documents, Groups, and Meetings &amp; Presentations sections, while they don't 
give brief intros to further information, do provide a list of items that pertain 
to that section. For all of these sections, the left-hand navigation links to 
different sections of the content in the right-hand column.</p>
<p>Sections that have dynamic information (News, Projects and Tools &amp; Software) 
are in a bit of a flux right now. The intent is to have the left-hand navigation 
links be actual call-outs to a database with the retrieved information then showing 
up in the right-hand column content area. However since that service is not quite 
ready for prime time, there is an interim page structure.</p>
<p>In all cases, we stay w/ the left-hand navigation - right-hand content structure. 
For DCMI News and for Projects, the left-hand navigation links to separate .shtml 
pages. For Tools &amp; Software, the left-hand navigation links to different parts 
of the right-hand column content (w/o going to separate pages). </p>
<p>For the entire site, once you get to the bottom level of the content, you get 
a plain page w/ just header &amp; footers - no left hand navigation. This is most 
often used in the &quot;About the Initiative&quot; section.</p>
<p><a name="home"></a></p>
<p><b>HOME PAGE:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The DCMI Home page is divided into five sections. </p>
<ul>
<li>The first section at the top of the page is the Header. This is a server- 
side include. Links in this section are: About the Initiative, DCMI News, Documents, 
Groups, Resources, Tools &amp; Software, Meetings &amp; Presentations and Projects.</li>
<li>Left-hand side navigation: 
<ul>
<li>Overview Section - To a certain extent this is a repeat of the Header navigation. 
We added &quot;Contact&quot; and dropped &quot;Groups&quot; from the top. We felt 
that a repeat of the header links would give users 2 places to &quot;expect&quot; 
the information that they are looking for. We added &quot;Contact&quot; (raising 
it in visibility from under the &quot;About the Initiative&quot; section) on advice 
from Zot. Also because we felt that it might be a commonly sought link. We dropped 
&quot;Groups&quot; from the Overview section, because they are listed on the right-hand 
side.</li>
<li>Ready Reference Section - This is a group of no more than 6 of the top requested 
pages on the site. This will change once the site goes live and we can track what 
the most requested pages are, but for now we seeded this section w/ the pages 
that we thought most people would be interested in and which were a bit deeper 
in the site.</li>
<li>Search - This is pretty obvious.</li>
<li>Mirrors - Once our mirror sites stablize, they will be listed under a &quot;Mirrors&quot; 
banner on this side of the front page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right-hand side navigation: 
<ul>
<li>Working Groups and Special Interest Groups - The thought was to list the individual 
working groups on the home page as a service to &quot;power users.&quot; Community 
members who knew exactly where they wanted to go.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Center Column News Items: This section is very dynamic with all announcements 
relating to DCMI showing up here for some period of time. These announcements 
are listed in a news.txt file. This is part of the RSS news feed that we have 
on the site. All of the news items will have an icon associated with it. The different 
types of news announcements that we anticipate are: &quot;General Announcements&quot; 
- items that relate to DCMI as a whole; &quot;New Document&quot; for newly added 
documents or announcements when a document changes status; &quot;New Tool &amp; 
Software&quot; for newly available tools and/or software; &quot;New Project&quot; 
for newly announced projects using Dublin Core; and &quot;New Meeting&quot; for 
announcements of upcoming meetings, seminars or calls for participation. Any links 
that are made from these news items to documents or pages on the site must have 
the complete URL - not a relative URL. This news feed will be picked up by sites 
outside of the DCMI site and we need to have the complete link in order for people 
off site to follow it. To keep scrolling at a minimum, we are trying to keep the 
number of news items listed to 7 or less. All of these news items are also listed 
in the appropriate section of DCMI News.</li>
<li>The fifth section is the server-side footer.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>ABOUT THE INITIATIVE:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>This section deal with areas that reflect the structure, personnel and the 
policies of the DCMI Initiative itself. The information in this area is relatively 
static. The sections in this directory are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DCMI Overview: The Overview is a general introduction to DCMI, what the element 
set is, and how people can participate in the discussions.</li>
<li>DCMI Community: This is a listing of the types of organizations that participate 
in the DCMI with additional information about the institutions that have sponsored 
DC workshops.</li>
<li>DCMI History: This area is still under development. The intent is for anecdotal 
and personal information, remarks and photographs that pertain to the history 
of the DCMI</li>
<li>DCMI Organization: This is an indepth description of how DCMI works. It also 
includes pages listing: 
<ul>
<li>DC-EC and DC-AC committee members</li>
<li>Past committee members</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DCMI Contacts: A simple list of contacts that can be made w/ the web team, 
a separate link to Zot for media inquiries and places for people to submit new 
news items, projects, tools etc.</li>
<li>DCMI Liaisons: A listing of memoranda of understanding and agreements with 
other metadata and standards organizations</li>
<li>DCMI Technology: This is a section that started w/ Zot. It mostly comes across 
as part of a glossary, but I think it should and will cover the new technologies 
that are used on this web site - such as RSS, RDF, DC metadata etc.</li>
<li>DCMI Policies: A list of the policies that are in force on this web site (privacy 
and copyright - both of which were borrowed w/ permission from W3C) and the Public 
Open Source Software license.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="news"></a></p>
<p><b>DCMI NEWS</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>All the content in this section is listed in reverse chronological order, with 
the most recent information listed at the top. There are 5 different types of 
announcements that are listed in the news section. Each of these announcements 
is listed in a .txt page. The structure of the news item is similar to the news.txt 
file that populates the home page, but in the news section, we don't repeat the 
news icon with each item. The different types of announcements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Announcements - news items about: 
<ul>
<li>changes in the DCMI structure</li>

<li>web site changes</li>
<li>foreign language translations</li>

<li>working group announcements</li>
<li>anything else that doesn't fit into the other 4 categories</li>
<li>publication of DCMI Update</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meetings &amp; Presentations - news items about: 
<ul>

Core metadata</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="documents"></a></p>
<p><b>DOCUMENTS</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The DCMI web site is the official repository for all official DCMI documents. 
If the document is not on the site, it cannot be considered &quot;official.&quot; 
This will require a culture change for the working drafts since past practice 
has been to allow the working group chairs to put them up where ever it was most 
convienent for them and then linking to them off of the DCMI web site. A decision 
should also be made about whether the various draft versions of past documents 
should be brought onto the site.</p>
<p>On the index page for this directory (/documents/index.shtml) all the documents 
are listed by publishing date and are in reverse chronological order, grouped 
by document type.</p>
<p>Documents are added onto the web site based on the date of publication. The 
directory structure for official documents is as follows:</p>
<p>Under the documents directory, there should be sub-directories showing the 
year of publication /month of publication/day of publication /name of file/</p>
<p>The name of the file is important since it is a name that should stay w/ the 
document throughout it's life-cycle - thus Education working group - working draft 
is not a good title. However a document that is looking at how best to encode 
qualified Dublin Core metadata in HTML could have the following file structure:</p>
<p>2000/08/05/dcq-html/</p>
<p>You just have to remember to keep it unique from all of the other previously 
named documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="meetings"></a></p>
<p><b>MEETINGS AND PRESENTATIONS</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>This is a list of all meetings and presentations (upcoming and past) connected 
w/ DCMI including working group and BOF meetings. These meetings could be held 
during scheduled DCMI workshops or outside of the workshops. It also includes 
links to meeting home pages and meeting reports as available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="projects"></a></p>
<p><b>PROJECTS</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Currently this directory has an index page with left-hand navigation that links 
to 3 additional .shtml pages. The goal, eventually, is for the left-hand navigation 
to be actual call-outs to databases rather than links to other pages. But in the 
meantime the project information gets copied onto at least 3 different pages. 
The initial breakdown of projects is:</p>
<ul>
<li> alphabetical listing by project title (which is what comes up on the index 
page), </li>
<li> geographical listing for where the project originates- (currently there are 
pages for projects from 
<ul>
<li>Australasia - Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan and Korea</li>
<li>Europe - includes Russia &amp; it's sister countries</li>
<li>North America - Canada, USA and Mexico</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subject listing - which has been reworked but not yet implemented</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="tools"></a></p>
<p><b>TOOLS &amp; SOFTWARE</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>Currently this directory has an index page with left-hand navigation that links 
to different sections of the page. The goal, eventually, is for the left-hand 
navigation to be actual call-outs to databases rather than links to other places. 
But in the meantime the tool information gets listed on this long, flat page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="resources"></a></p>
<p><b>RESOURCES</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>This section is intended to act as the educational component of the DCMI web 
site. It currently contains a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bibliography</li>
<li>FAQ</li>
<li>a list of DCMI document translations 
<ul>
<li>There has been some discussion that these documents belong on the official 
DCMI document lists. However since they do not go through an &quot;approval&quot; 
process and just show up when &quot;translated&quot; bya an individual or agency, 
I made the decision that they do not belong on the official documents page. Each 
of the affected documents does have a link to this page so that uses can see if 
there is an appropriate translation for their needs available. Once there is some 
sort of process to officially approve of the translations, then they can/should 
become part of the official document list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other resources that I intend(ed) to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>A listing of other user guides that are available from the different projects 
the employ Dublin Core.</li>
<li>On-line education (distance education) modules that teach how to create Dublin 
Core records</li>
<li>Glossary - the usage guide created by Diane Hillmann has a glossery link, 
but it is to an out-of-date site that uses the old DC logo. I thought it would 
be better to bring that glossary onto the web site and then extend it on the DCMI 
web site.</li>
<li>Seminars and other conferences that are not sponsored by DCMI but that teach 
Dublin Core metadata </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="workshops"></a></p>
<p><b>WORKSHOPS</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p>The index page for the workshops directory (/workshops/index.shtml) should 
list in reverse chronological order all of the official DCMI workshops or conferences. 
Each listing should include the date of the workshop, location, co-sponsoring 
institution, and link to the workshop home page w/in the workshop directory.</p>
<p>Each workshop should have its own directory. An index page in the directory 
should contain a link to the call for participation, workshop homepage, workshop 
report and any additional links to other resources or meeting notes that come 
from the meeting.</p>
<p>If DCMI maintained the workshop site - all pages should go into this directory.</p>
<p>If the site was developed and hosted by a different institution, then once 
the workshop is completed, we should get a dump of the pages and place them into 
the ARCHIVES. Then off of the workshop page /workshops/dcX/index.shtml - we can 
provide a link to the official workshop web site as well as a link to the local 
cached version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>DIRECTORIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT HIDDEN FROM VIEW TO MOST USERS:</b></p>
<blockquote> 
<p><b>ARCHIVES:</b> This is where we dump copies of sites and pages that are not 
created by DCMI, but contain information that is important to the historical record 
of the Initiative. The subdirectories are created by YYYY/ name of file/ Currently 
included in the archives is a dump of the qualifier voting records and the dc7 
workshop in Frankfurt germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>SUGGESTIONS AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Place a &quot;netminder&quot; watch on each of the project home pages. It 
will be easier to track when something moves or goes away.</li>
<li>Create a projects from South America page</li>
<li>implement the revised subject lists for the projects section</li>
<li>continue to work on creating database entries for each of the projects as 
well as tools and software items.</li>
<li>provide alternate formats for printing DC recommendations (and the Usage Guide) 
- printing HTML pages is inadequate.</li>
</ul>
