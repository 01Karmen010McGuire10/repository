<h1>Organization and Coding</h1>
<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative website is the definitive record for the organization, providing access to the ongoing development of standards required to provide clear, principled and consistent guidelines for deploying Dublin Core metadata. Additionally, this site is the gateway to supporting projects, tools, and activities and strives to serve as the first place to start for metadata on the Web.</p>
<p>The recent redesign of the DCMI website has a much easier interface to navigate and use than its predecessor. It was designed using a consistent hierarchy of information. That means the basic elements of the site&#151;from the placement of the global navigation to the use of color&#151;remain consistent from page to page. This makes the service easier to use and the information more understandable to the user.</p>
<p>The overall service has a more modern and casual appearance and is presented with the color orange, representing communication, ambition, expansiveness, richness, and receptivity.</p>
