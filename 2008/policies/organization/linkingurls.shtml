<h1>Linking URLs</h1>
<h2>Absolute paths</h2>
<p>Absolute paths provide the complete URL of the linked document, including the protocol to use (usually http:// for web pages). For example, <b>http://www.w3c.org/</b> is an absolute path. Absolute paths are only used to link to a document on another server.</p>
<h2>Root-relative paths</h2>
<p>Root-relative paths provide the path from the site's root folder to a document. Root-relative paths should always be used for links between documents within the DCMI website.</p>
<p>A root-relative path begins with a leading forward slash, which stands for the site root level. For example, <b>/about/organization/committemembers.shtml</b> is a root-relative path to the <b>committemembers.shtml</b> file in the <b>organization</b> subfolder of the <b>about</b> subfolder of the site's root level.</p>
<p>Links to the default page in a directory, <b>index.shtml</b>, should not include the default page in the link. For example, <b>/about/contact/</b> is the proper path to the <b>index.shtml</b> file in the <b>contact</b> subfolder of the <b>about</b> subfolder of the site's root level.</p>
<p>A root-relative path often provides the best way to specify links in a website in which you need to frequently move HTML files from one folder to another. When you move a document that contains root-relative links, you don't need to change the links; for example, if your HTML files use root-relative links for dependent files (such as images), then if you move an HTML file, its dependent-file links are still valid. However, when you move or rename the documents linked to with root-relative links, you do need to update those links, even if the documents' paths relative to each other haven't changed. For example, if you move a folder, all root-relative links to files within that folder must be updated.</p>
<p>Root-relative links are interpreted by servers, not by browsers, so if you open a local page that uses root-relative links in your browser, the links will not work. Previewing pages in framesets that use root-relative links results in similar problems.</p>
