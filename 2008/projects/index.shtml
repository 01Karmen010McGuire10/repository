<p><strong>The Application of Dublin Core Metadata Standard in UiTM Libraries for Kedah, Shah Alam, and Kelantan Campus:
The Benefits</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This research will be conducted from December 2004 until November 2005. This research will study in depth about the
Dublin Core Metadata Standard and the possibility of implementing this system in generic organization of information
for other type of printed and non-printed materials existed in UiTM libraries. This is in order to support the process
of teaching, learning and researching for all staff and student at those three campuses. The objective of this research
are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The benefit of this system and the possibility of adopting Dublin Core Metadata Standard in UiTM libraries,</li>
<li>Flexibility of this standard to be implemented in library system in order to allow data sharing throughout UiTM
libraries for these three campuses,</li>
<li>The standard usage level of complexity for it to be utilized by users either, lecturers, student and other staff.</li>
</ol>
<p>The scope of this project will include a main campus and two branch campuses that are the main campus Shah Alam,
followed by Sungai Petani campus, and Machang campus with an academic library.  The planned limitation of work will
include data collection work and the most suitable period to collect data. Furthermore, the policy that is going to be
used in the research as a unit analysis is Dublin Core Metadata Standard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The MALVINE project opens new and enhanced access to disparate holdings of modern manuscripts and letters,
kept and catalogued in European libraries, archives, documentation centers and museums. The idea of MALVINE is
to build a network of these institutions in Europe; a network which is independent of heterogeneous technical
solutions (Detailed technical information) and which is accessible from all over the world as if being a homogenous
unified database. A multilingual user interface will be provided, using an agreed common terminology and will offer
digitized surrogates of the precious original documents.</p>

<p>Metadata for online theses and dissertations in Germany. Since 1998 a metadata set &quot;MetaDiss&quot;,
based on DCMS of 1998, has been used in Germany for interchange of metadata and corresponding full text of
online university theses and dissertations. The great majority of German university libraries (73 of 100
possible ones) participate in this process.</p>
<p>In the project a metadata set &quot;XMetaDiss&quot; for online university theses and dissertations is
being developed and will be defined by means of XML DTD as well as XML schema. This metadata set is supposed
to relieve the set MetaDiss which is up to now embedded into HTML4. The potential of XMetaDiss consists in</p>
<ul>
<li>the use for an automatic compiling-process of metadata of online university theses and dissertations by
OAI protocol</li>
<li>the targeted compatibility with the NDLTD-set ETDMS</li>
<li>the use of hierarchical patterns and the avoidance of allocation errors (up to now the allocation occurred
only through the sequence of the elements)</li>
<li>and the simple transformation potentiality by means of XSLT into other metadata formats, as ETDMS and DC
simple.</li>
</ul>
<p>The inclusion in an international framework, depending on sufficient agreement with libraries and library
service centres in Germany, points to a high acceptance of a new metadata format for online university theses
and dissertations, corresponding to the state of the art.</p>
