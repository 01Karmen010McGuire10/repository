        <p>As part of its mission, the Dublin Core Metadata
        Initiative develops and maintains specifications in
        support of resource description.  Specifications
        developed and reviewed in the context of DCMI's <a
        href="/documents/approval/">formal approval process</a>
        are assigned a status (in ascending order of maturity
        and stability) of "DCMI Working Draft", "DCMI Proposed
        Recommendation", or "DCMI Recommendation".
        DCMI also provides pointers to guidelines and
        services developed outside of this formal review context
        ("Recommended Resources").</p>

        <p>This selection highlights the specifications that
        currently attract the most attention in the Dublin Core
        community.  Links to additional specifications
        (including superseded specifications) may be found at <a
        href="/documents/">http://dublincore.org/documents/</a>.
        Some of the specifications have been <a
        href="/resources/translations/">translated</a> into one
        of twenty-five languages.</p>

  <h2>Semantic Recommendations</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dcmi-terms/">DCMI Metadata Terms</a></strong> [DCMI Recommendation].
  This periodically updated document provides a one-stop source of up-to-date 
  information on DCMI metadata terms, including the classic Dublin Core Metadata
  Element Set, the DCMI Type Vocabulary, and resource classes used as formal domains
  and ranges.  Supporting documents includes</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="/documents/dcmi-namespace/">DCMI Namespace Policy</a> [DCMI Recommendation].
      This document describes how metadata terms are assigned URIs
      by DCMI and the policies governing changes to the documented meanings 
      associated with those URIs.</li>
  <li><a href="/schemas/rdfs/">DCMI term declarations represented in RDF schema language</a>.
      Since 2001, DCMI term declarations have been published as Web documents
      (with the status DCMI Recommendation) and, in parallel, as machine-processable 
      RDF/XML documents.</li>
  <li><a href="http://purl.org/dcregistry/">The Dublin Core Metadata Registry</a> 
      [DCMI Recommended Resource].  This application, hosted at the
      University of Tsukuba as a service for the DCMI community, provides a 
      <a href="http://dcmi.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/dcregistry/navigateServlet">navigational 
      interface</a> to DCMI's machine-processable RDF term declarations.
      The registry is under development as an open-source software project.</li>
  <li><a href="/documents/dces/">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> [DCMI Recommendation].
      This document excerpts from DCMI Metadata Terms the 
      fifteen elements of the classic "Dublin Core", which has been standardized as
      <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=15836&searchSubmit=Search&sort=rel&type=simple&published=on">ISO 
      Standard 15836:2009</a>.</li>

  <h2>User guidelines</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/interoperability-levels/">Interoperability
  Levels for Dublin Core Metadata</a></strong> [DCMI Recommended
  Resource].  This document articulates current
  thinking in the Dublin Core community about the nature of
  metadata interoperability. <a href="/beta/metadata-basics">Read 
  more...</a> 
  </p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/profile-guidelines/">Guidelines
  for Dublin Core Application Profiles</a></strong> [DCMI Recommended Resource].
  This document provides guidelines for the creation of Dublin
  Core Application Profiles.  The document explains the key
  components of a Dublin Core Application Profile and walks
  through the process of developing a profile.  The document is
  aimed at designers of application profiles -- people who will
  bring together metadata terms for use in a specific context.
  </p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/singapore-framework/">Singapore
  Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles</a></strong> [DCMI Recommended Resource].
  The Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles
  is a framework for designing metadata applications for maximum
  interoperability and for documenting such applications for
  maximum reusability.  The framework defines a set of
  descriptive components that are necessary or useful for
  documenting an Application Profile and describes how these
  documentary standards relate to standard domain models and
  Semantic Web foundation standards.  The framework forms a
  basis for reviewing Application Profiles for documentary
  completeness and for conformance with Web-architectural
  principles.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/usageguide/">Using Dublin
  Core</a></strong> [DCMI Recommended Resource].  From January
  1998 through the latest version in November 2005, this
  document was maintained as the main entry point for new users
  of Dublin Core metadata.  While this document is accessibly
  written, with useful concrete examples, readers should be
  aware that the document is by now somewhat out of date and is
  best used in conjunction with <a
  href="/documents/profile-guidelines/">Guidelines
  for Dublin Core Application Profiles</a>.</p>

  <h2>Model-related specifications</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/abstract-model/">DCMI Abstract
     Model</a></strong> [DCMI Recommendation].  This
     document specifies an abstract syntax for "description
     sets" (metadata records).  Finalized as a DCMI
     Recommendation in March 2005, the DCMI Abstract Model
     (DC-AM) expressed the style of metadata that had emerged in
     the Dublin Core community over the previous decade as
     formal constructs based on the W3C Resource Description
     Framework (for example, by giving a formal definition to
     the DC-specific notion of a "vocabulary encoding scheme"
     and providing for the use of parallel labels in multiple
     languages).  The Abstract Model was designed to bridge the
     modern paradigm of the unbounded, linked data graph and the
     more familiar paradigm of the validatable metadata record,
     providing a foundation for the development of
     application-independent syntax specifications and
     constraint languages.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dc-text/">Expressing Dublin
     Core metadata using the DC-Text format</a></strong> [DCMI
     Working Draft].  DC-Text is a syntax for representing a
     DC-AM Description Set in plain text.  Its primary use is
     in presenting metadata constructs for human consumption.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dc-dsp/">Description
     Set Profiles: A constraint language for Dublin Core
     Application Profiles</a></strong> [DCMI Working Draft].
     This document specifies an application-independent language
     for the constraints used in defining "templates" for
     metadata records -- for example, to specify a template for
     records which describe exactly "one book", with "up to ten
     authors", using "subject headings from the Library of
     Congress".  This specification represents work in progress
     and is likely to evolve in response to implementation
     experience.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/profile-review-criteria/">Criteria
     for the Review of Application Profiles</a></strong> [DCMI
     Recommended Resource]. This document was developed by
     the DCMI Usage Board to evaluate Application Profiles for
     documentary completeness and for conformance with
     linked-data principles.  The criteria are based on the DCMI
     Abstract Model, Description Set Profile (DSP) language, and
     Singapore Framework.  Even when conformance with these
     specifications is not a requirement, implementers may find
     these review criteria useful for uncovering flaws or
     weaknesses in the logic of an application profile.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dsp-wiki-syntax/">A
     MoinMoin Wiki Syntax for Description Set
     Profiles</a></strong> [DCMI Working Draft].  Using this
     draft syntax, editors can embed formal constraint
     information about application profiles into normal Wiki
     documents and extract this information using an <a
     href="/documents/2008/10/06/dsp-wiki-syntax/DescriptionSetProfile-dist.zip">Open
     Source MoinMoin Wiki tool</a> into an XML representation.
     This functionality is illustrated by the <a
     href="http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/EprintsApplicationProfile?action=DSP2XML">MoinMoin
     Wiki document for the Scholarly Works Application
     Profile</a>.</p>

  <h2>Syntax guidelines</h2>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dc-html/">DC-HTML</a></strong> [DCMI 
     Recommendation].  "Expressing Dublin Core metadata using
     HTML/XHTML meta and link elements" describes how a Dublin
     Core metadata description set can be encoded using the
     HTML/XHTML &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;link&gt; elements.  This
     specification is also an HTML "meta data profile" as
     defined by the HTML specification.  See also:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><a href="http://rdfa.info/">RDFa</a>, another syntax for embedding
       Dublin Core descriptions in Web pages, which became a
       <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">W3C Recommendation</a>
       in October 2008 and has strong tool support in platforms
       such as <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and
       Yahoo's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/searchmonkey/">Search
       Monkey</a>.</li>
     <li>The predecessor specification for DC-HTML, 
       <a href="/documents/dcq-html/">DCQ-HTML</a> (last updated in 2003), 
       consistently remains one of the most-accessed documents on the DCMI 
       Web site despite its clearly marked status as a &quot;Superseded Recommendation&quot;.  
       Early versions of this specifications used the so-called "dotty" syntax
       for appending an additional &quot;qualifier&quot; to an element name.
       as with &quot;DC.Coverage.temporal&quot; -- an encoding style that is now 
       discouraged.  This and other related issues are discussed in
       <a href="/documents/dc-html-notes/">&quot;Notes on DCMI 
       specifications for Dublin Core metadata in HTML/XHTML meta and link 
       elements&quot;</a>.</li>
     </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dc-ds-xml/">DC-DS-XML</a></strong> 
  [Proposed Recommendation]. &quot;Expressing Dublin Core 
  Description Sets using XML (DC-DS-XML)&quot; specifies an XML format for 
  representing a Dublin Core metadata description set. The specification
  supports all of the features of a Description Set as described by the DCMI Abstract Model.
  Related resources include:</p>
     <ul>
     <li><a href="/documents/dc-ds-xml-notes/">Notes on
       DC-DS-XML XML Format</a>, which describes the development of
       the format and its relationship to the 2003 specification, DC-XML-GUIDELINES.</li>

     <li><a href="/documents/dc-xml-guidelines/">DC-XML-GUIDELINES</a>
       [DCMI Recommendation].  The specification "Guidelines for
       implementing Dublin Core in XML" of April 2003 has been
       used in numerous implementations and remains popular
       despite its well-described limitations (see above).  
       <a href="/schemas/">XMLS schemas</a> implementing the 
       2003 encoding conventions are available in several
       variants.</li> 
     </ul>

  <p><strong><a href="/documents/dc-rdf/">DC-RDF</a></strong>
  [DCMI Recommendation].  &quot;Expressing Dublin Core metadata
  using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)&quot; describes
  how constructs of the DCMI Abstract Model may be expressed in
  RDF graphs.  How this document relates to earlier styles for
  expressing Dublin Core metadata in RDF is discussed in <a
  href="/documents/dc-rdf-notes/">&quot;Notes on DCMI
  specifications for Dublin Core metadata in RDF&quot;.</p>
