    <h2>Proposal 1:<br />
     dc-ed:audience Element</h2>

    <p>In the education and training domain, the capacity to
    designate various aspects of the intended users of (or audience
    for) the educational resource being described is an important
    function for networked information discovery and retrieval.</p>

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> audience<br />
     <strong>Label:</strong> Audience<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> A category of user for whom the
    resource is intended.<br />
     <strong>Comment:</strong> Frequently, creators and publishers
    of resources in education and training explicitly state the
    category of user for whom the resource is intended. In like
    fashion, end-users in the education/training domain frequently
    search using audience characteristics as search terms.<br />
     <strong>See Also:</strong> dc-ed:audience Element discussion
    in the <a
    href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dc-ed/Dc-ac/DC-Education_Report.html">
    Report of Deliberations</a>.</p>

    <center>
      <h4>Proposed Encoding Schemes for dc-ed:audience:</h4>
    </center>

    <p>DCEd recognizes the need for increased search precision
    through the use of controlled vocabularies. Various
    implementations in the education domain have adopted such
    element encoding schemes to denote various classes of audience
    traits based on national, organizational, and cultural needs.
    No DCEd element encoding schemes are put forward in this
    proposal.</p>

    <center>
      <h4>Proposed Qualifier that Refines dc-ed:audience: [1]</h4>
    </center>

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> mediator<br />
     <strong>Label:</strong> Mediator<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> An entity that mediates access to
    the resource.<br />
     <strong>Comment:</strong> The audience for a resource in the
    education/training domain are of two basic classes: (1) an
    utimate beneficiary of the resource (usually a student or
    trainee), and (2) frequently, an entity that mediates access to
    the resource (usually a teacher or trainor). The dc-ed:mediator
    element refinement represents the second of these two
    classes.</p>

    <center>
      <h4>Proposed Encoding Schemes for dc-ed:mediator:</h4>
    </center>

    <p>DCEd recognizes the need for increased search precision
    through the use of controlled vocabularies. Various
    implementations in the education domain have adopted such
    element encoding schemes to denote types of mediators based on
    national, organizational, and cultural needs. No DCEd value
    qualifier encoding schemes are put forward in this
    proposal.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">[1] DCEd recognizes that in addition to the
    dc-ed:mediator element refinement, dc-ed:audience may be more
    precisely expressed in the education domain through a number of
    facets denoting audience traits (e.g., education/training
    level, levels of pysical and intellectual ability, etc.). These
    traits will most likely suggest additional element refinements
    in the future. No such additional element refinements are put
    forward in this proposal.</font></p>
    <hr  />

    <h2>Proposal 2:<br />
     dc-ed:standard Element [2]</h2>

    <p>In the education and training domain, the capacity to
    designate various academic and process standards to which the
    educational/training resource being described has been
    associated is an important function for networked information
    discovery and retrieval. Frequently, end-users search for
    resources that are useful in helping students/trainees in
    achieving educational goals and objectives as promulgated by
    various companies, organizations, and governmental bodies.</p>

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> standards<br />
     <strong>Label:</strong> Standards<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> A reference to an established
    education or training standard to which the resource is
    associated. [3]<br />
     <strong>See Also:</strong> dc-ed:standard Element discussion
    in the <a
    href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/sasutton/dc-ed/Dc-ac/DC-Education_Report.html">
    Report of Deliberations</a>.</p>

    <center>
      <h4>Proposed Encoding Schemes for dc-ed:standards:</h4>
    </center>

    <p>The recommended scheme for dc-ed:standard is the Uniform
    Resource Identifier (URI) referencing a process or content
    standard. In the absence of a URI, good practice includes the
    text of the standard being associated with reference to the
    controlling scheme.</p>

    <center>
      <h4>Proposed Qualifiers that refine dc-ed:standard:</h4>
    </center>

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> identifier<br />
     <strong>Label:</strong> Identifier<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> Where available, an identifier
    that serves to uniquely identify the standard being
    associated.</p>

    <p><strong>Name:</strong> version<br />
     <strong>Label:</strong> Version<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> Information identifying the
    version of the standard being referenced (e.g., a year of
    publication, a version number, etc.).<br />
     <strong>Comment:</strong> Occasionally, the unique
    identification of a standard is a function of both an
    identifier and a version.</p>

    <p><font size="-1">[2] The dc-ed:standard proposal is one of
    two alternative mechanisms for handling the need to reference
    academic and process standards. See also, Proposal 3
    below.</font></p>

    general description is: &ldquo;A reference to an established
    standard to which the resource is associated.&rdquo;</font></p>

    <h2>Proposal 3:<br />
     dc-ed:conforms to Qualifier to the dc:relation Element
    [4]</h2>

    <p>In the education and training domain, the capacity to
    designate various academic and process standards to which the
    educational/training resource being described has been
    associated is an important function for networked information
    discovery and retrieval. Frequently, end-users search for
    resources that are useful in helping students/trainees in
    achieving educational goals and objectives as promulgated by
    various companies, organizations, and governmental bodies.</p>

     <strong>Label:</strong> ConformsTo<br />
     <strong>Definition:</strong> A reference to an established
    education or training standard to which the resource is
    associated. [5]<br />

    <h2>Proposal 4:<br />
     Endorsements of Data Elements in the IEEE LOM/IMS
    Namspace</h2>

    <p>In conformance with the DCMI commitment to modular metadata,
    DCEd proposes <em>endorsement</em> of the use of the
    <em>InteractivityType</em>, <em>InteractivityLevel</em>, and
    <em>TypicalLearningTime</em> data elements (Education Category:
    5.1, 5.3, and 5.9 respectively) from the IEEE Learning Object
    Metadata (LOM) standard for P1484.12.</p>
