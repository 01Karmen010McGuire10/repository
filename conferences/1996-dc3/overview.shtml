    <h1 align="center">CNI/OCLC Metadata Workshop</h1>

    <h1 align="center">Workshop on Metadata for Networked
    Images</h1>

    <h3 align="center">September 24-25, 1996<br />
    Online Computer Library Center, Inc.<br />
    Dublin, Ohio, USA</h3>

    <p align="left"><strong>Overview</strong></p>

    <p align="left">The Coalition for Networked Information (CNI)
    and OCLC are organizing an invitational workshop in Dublin,
    Ohio on September 24 and 25 to promote convergence among
    alternative approaches to describing images and imagebases in
    networked environments. This workshop will build upon the
    outcomes of a workshop that OCLC organized last fall to address
    the general issue of metadata in networked environments. It
    will address the metadata requirements of networked images and
    imagebases by refining and extending the "Dublin core" of
    metadata elements that resulted from that previous
    workshop.</p>

    <p align="left">Digital images ranging from paintings and
    buildings to CAT scans and x-rays to planetary landscapes and
    astronomical objects are now available in great numbers on the
    Internet, and more such images are becoming available every
    day. Widely accepted and used standards for describing these
    images and their associated imagebases are urgently needed to
    facilitate the planning of image creation and conversion
    projects and to enable the discovery of existing images that
    can be used in research, teaching, and learning activities.
    This workshop will bring together a critical mass of experts
    who are working in this area so that they can share information
    on their respective efforts and clear the ground on which image
    and imagebase metadata standards will be built.</p>

    <p align="left">The workshop will focus on still images, such
    as photographs, slides, and graphics. It will not deal with
    moving images, such as films, videos, and simulations, nor will
    it deal with images of textual objects, such as page
    facsimiles. It will, however, capture<br />
    the requirements of the wide range of disciplines (e.g. art,
    architecture, engineering, medicine, and the life, physical,
    and social sciences) that create and use images and imagebases,
    and it will identify the requirements that are common to all
    disciplines<br />
    versus those that are unique to individual disciplines.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Process</strong></p>

    <p align="left">If you are interested in participating in this
    workshop then please contact the person identified below on or
    before June 15, 1996 (a) to declare your interest in
    participating, (b) to describe your experience to-date with
    creating or using digital images or imagebases in networked
    environments, and, (c) to suggest key issues or topics that
    should be addressed by the workshop, together with your views
    on those issues and topics.</p>

    <p align="left">If you know of a project or a person that you
    believe should be represented at or invited to this workshop
    then please (a) forward this call for statements of interest
    and experience as soon as possible to a representative of the
    project or to the person you have in mind, or (b) contact the
    person identified below as soon as possible with the title of
    the project or the name of the person you have in mind together
    with a brief description of the reason why you think a
    representative of that project or that person should
    participate.</p>

    <p align="left">CNI and OCLC are particularly interested in
    receiving statements from and nominations of faculty members,
    researchers, and other "content" originators and users so that
    the workshop might benefit from their participation as well as
    that of archivists, librarians, information technologists, and
    other professional developers and managers of information
    infrastructures, resources, and services.</p>

    <p align="left">There will be no registration fee for this
    workshop. CNI and OCLC will take responsibility for all staff,
    speaker, materials, facility, and food expenses arising from
    this workshop. The workshop participants will be responsible
    for their individual travel and housing expenses.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>

    <p align="left">CNI, a joint project of the Association for
    Research Libraries, CAUSE, and Educom, was founded in March,
    1990 to promote the creation of and access to information
    resources in networked environments in order to enrich
    scholarship and to enhance intellectual productivity.</p>

    <p align="left">OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) is a
    non-profit computer library service and research organization
    whose computer network and services link more that 22,000
    libraries in 63 countries and territories. Additional
    information about OCLC and its services can be found at
    &lt;URL:<a
    href="http://www.oclc.org">http://www.oclc.org</a>&gt;</p>

    <p align="left">Currently 212 organizations and institutions,
    including OCLC, belong to the CNI Task Force, a group that
    makes special contributions to the Coalition's projects and
    activities. Included in the Task Force membership are higher
    education institutions,<br />
    publishers, network service providers, computer hardware and
    system companies, library networks and organizations, and
    public and state libraries.</p>

    <p align="left">Periodically CNI issues a call for statements
    of interest and experience as a vehicle for announcing
    initiatives in a manner that promotes the widest and fairest
    possible identification of institutions, organizations, and
    individuals willing and able to contribute to those
    initiatives. Each call provides a brief description of the
    initiative in question, and some calls include supporting
    documents.</p>

    <p align="left">Individuals do not have to be affiliated with
    or employed by a member of the CNI Task Force, or of ARL,
    CAUSE, or Educom, to respond to a call for statements of
    interest and experience.</p>

    <p align="left">Statements of interest and experience are
    reviewed by CNI staff with the assistance of the leaders of
    relevant CNI Working Groups and the guidance of members of the
    CNI Steering Committee. Other parties are involved as needed.
    Additional information is sometimes requested during this
    review process.</p>

    <p align="left">Reviews of statements of interest and
    experience are carried out in as expeditious and as flexible a
    fashion as possible, taking care to balance the benefits of a
    wide and fair search for individuals able and willing to
    contribute to particular initiatives with the<br />
    benefits of focused and timely action on those initiatives.</p>

    <p align="left">Upon selection of the individuals to
    participate in a given initiative, CNI staff notify all those
    who submitted a response to the call of their status.</p>

    program can be obtained from the person identified above and
