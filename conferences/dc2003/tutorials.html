<p><h3>Tutorial 1: <font color=#ff0000>Encoding DC in (X)HTML and XML</font></h3>
<p><div class="dcText"><strong>Monday, 29 September 2003<br>8:30-10:00, Bay Auditorium</strong></div></p>


<p><strong>Presenter: Andy Powell</strong></p>

<p>This tutorial will present a generic model for 'simple' and 'qualified' Dublin Core metadata records and will investigate how that model can be encoded in (X)HTML 'meta' tags, XML and RDF. A number of case studies, based on the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and RSS, will show how XML and DC are being used in practice.</p>
<p>No detailed prior knowledge of XML will be assumed but attendees should expect to see a significant number of angle brackets (&lt; &gt;) during the tutorial!

<p><h3>Tutorial 2: <font color=#ff0000>Dublin Core Application Profiles</font></h3>
<p><div class="dcText"><strong>Tuesday, 30 September 2003<br>8:30-10:00, Bay Auditorium</strong></div></p>

<p><strong>Presenters:  Rebecca Guenther, Rachel Heery, Andrew Wilson</strong></p>

<p>A Dublin Core Application Profile (DCAP) documents how an information provider or user community has adapted, constrained or extended Dublin Core for specific uses or applications.  DCAPs serve a range of purposes, from describing a particular set of metadata records to providing a focus for user communities to develop shared information models.  This tutorial will present the principles, format conventions and modeling issues involved in constructing DCAPs with reference to actual profiles for libraries and for government information.

<p><h3>Tutorial 3: <font color=#ff0000>Creative Commons - Digital Rights 
Description</font></h3>
<p><div class="dcText"><strong>Wednesday, 1 October 2003<br>8:30-10:00, Bay Auditorium</strong></div></p>

<p><strong>Presenter: Mike Linksvayer</strong></p>


<p><strong style="font-weight: 400">Creative Commons offers a legal, pragmatic 
alternative to &quot;all rights reserved&quot; copyright and Digital Rights Management -- 
a suite of &quot;some rights reserved&quot; licenses backed by RDF/XML metadata, for 
Digital Rights Description (DRD). This tutorial will cover practical and 
technical aspects of creating, publishing, verifying and searching Dublin Core 
metadata for DRD deployed on the web in HTML, RSS, and beyond, e.g., on 
Peer-2-Peer environments.</strong></p>

<p><h3>Tutorial 4: <font color=#ff0000>FAST Workshop</font></h3>
<p><div class="dcText"><strong>Thursday, 2 October 2003<br>8:30-10:00, Bay Auditorium</strong></div></p>

<p><strong>Presenter: Ed O'Neill and Eric Childress</strong></p>
</p>

<p>The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) schema is by far  the most commonly used and widely accepted subject vocabulary for general  application.  It is the de facto universal controlled vocabulary and has  been a model for developing new subject heading systems around the world.  However, LCSH's complex syntax and rules for constructing headings  restrict its application by requiring highly skilled personnel and limit  the effectiveness of automated authority control.</p>

 <p>Recent trends, driven to a large extent by the rapid growth of the Web  and the popularity of new metadata schemas, such as Dublin Core, are  forcing changes in subject indexing systems to make them easier to use,  understand, and apply.  FAST is a faceted adaptation of LCSH with a  simplified syntax which retains the very rich vocabulary of LCSH while  making it easier to understand and apply.  FAST consists of eight  distinct facets: Topical, Geographic (Place), Personal Name, Corporate  Name, Form (Type, Genre), Chronological (Time, Period), Title, and  Meeting Name.</p>

 <p>This workshop will review the development of FAST and look at how it can  be applied in the Dublin Core environment.

  Childress began his professional library career as an audiovisual materials 
  cataloger. At OCLC since 1996, he works as a metadata products and standards 
  specialist and has been the member of various OCLC projects including: OCLC 
  CORC (Cooperative Online Resource Catalog), OCLC CatExpress, and OCLC 
  Connexion. Currently on loan to OCLC Research, he is a member of the FAST 
  (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) and Metadata Switch Project 
  teams. Active with the Dublin Core, Eric has served as chair of the DC Date 
  Working Group, and member of the DC Library Application Profile Working Group 
  and the DC Advisory Board.<p><strong>Rebecca Guenther </strong>. Rebecca Guenther is Senior Networking and Standards Specialist in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress, where she has worked since 1989.  Her current responsibilities include work on national and international information technology standards, including ISO and NISO information standards. She serves as rotating chair of ISO 639 Joint Advisory Committee on language codes and as a member of the National Information Standards Organization's Standards Development Committee.  Rebecca has worked in the area of metadata since the early 1990s, including maintaining a number of crosswalks between various metadata schemes; contributing to the development of XML bibliographic description standards (Metadata Object Description Standard and MARCXML); serving as chair of the DCMI Libraries Working Group and as a member of the DCMI Usage Board; serving as a co-chair of PREMIS, an OCLC/RLG sponsored working group on preservation metadata implementation strategies; and, participating as vice-chair in the Open Ebook Forum's Metadata and Identifiers Working Group, among others.</p>

      <p><b>Mike Linksvayer.</b> Mike Linksvayer is Chief Technology Officer at 
      Creative Commons. A software engineer by practice, he has always found 
      himself responsible for (unconsciously drawn to?) the metadata aspects of 
      applications. He made the leap to metadata-centrism as a cofounder of 
      Bitzi, which provides RDF-encoded DC metadata largely to P2P applications.</p>
<p><div class="dcSidebar"><strong>Ed O'Neil</strong>. Edward T. O'Neill joined the staff at the Office of Research, OCLC Online Computer Library Center, as a Senior Research Scientist in 1983, serving as co-acting Director of Research from 1993 until 1994.
