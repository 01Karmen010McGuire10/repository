<font  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><p>In this group project, you have been assigned the task of researching and drafting a major policy instrument for a large metropolitan public library.  In order to fulfill the task, you must perform an appropriate level of research into background issues and the rights and obligations of the various stakeholders affected by the policy.</p>   

<p>The policy is to be thoroughly annotated in the sense that all of its directives must be authoritatively justified.  The appropriate method for handling the policy annotations as an academic exercise is by means of footnotes.  This means that the annotations (the footnotes) may far exceed the length of the actual policy instrument itself.  Both the depth and thoroughness of the annotations differentiate this assignment as an academic exercise here in LIS 550 from what might be submitted by a real world committee given the same assignment.  However, even in professional practice, the background knowledge of policy drafters should be no less complete than will be demonstrated through your annotations for this class exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Parts to the Annotated Policy:</strong></p>
<p>Each of the policies drafted consists of two distinct parts as defined below.  The two parts are inextricably related and should be internally consistent.  In essence, one part of the policy looks outward to the public and the other looks inward to the library personnel.  The two parts are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Public Policy Instrument</u>: This part of the assignment consists of the policy as it would be presented to the public.  It is important in preparing this part of the assignment that you draft the policy so that it can stand alone as a public pronouncement <em>minus the annotations</em>.</p></li>
<li><u>Personnel Policy Instrument</u>: Since the assignment addresses actions that will involve various professional and para-professional personnel of the library, this second part of the assignment consists of the policy <em>as implemented</em> at the level of personnel actions.  In other words, this part of the assignment defines the actions to be taken by personnel in the event enforcement of the policy becomes necessary.  This part can be as detailed as the circumstances require.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Autumn 2003 Policies:</strong></p>
<p>The group policy work for the Autumn 2003 class will focus on two very contemporary areas of concern to libraries of all kinds.  You are being given nothing more than the name of two U.S. federal laws that shape the policies of concern.  Beyond their names, it will be up to you find out everything you need to know to draft intelligent policy instruments for the library.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><u>Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA)</u></p></li>
<li><p><u>USA Patriots Act</u></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Assignment Logistics:</strong></p>
<p>Each student in the class will work on one of the Autumn 2003 Policies noted above.  Every effort will be made to accommodate policy preferences, but no guarantees are made that everyone will be able to work on the policy of their choice.  Approximately one half of the students will work on each policy area.  Those working in a single policy area will be divided into small policy report groups of approximatey six students each.  Group assignments for the project can be found on the <a href="../General/groupProjectRoster.html">Project Report Roster</a>.  Each report group will prepare a finished policy consisting of the two parts noted above.<p>

<p>It is important to remember as you work on the group assignment that the individual groups are not in competition for grades.  We encourage the groups and their individual members to share their findings and resources throughout the period when the research on these issues is happening.  Each of the two topical areas have a Web-based forum established by which matters can be discussed and resources shared.  We only ask that when the time comes to write the actual policies, that each group do its own work in architecting and drafting.</p>
