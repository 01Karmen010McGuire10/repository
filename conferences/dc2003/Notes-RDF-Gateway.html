<p><div class="gemText"><strong><font color=#ff0000>Faceted Search:</font></strong></p> 

<p>Note that the search engine for the Gateway+ is very different from the previous GEM search engines.  While the past GEM search engines may be characterized as basic boolean engines that permited the construction of fairly complex queries, they may also be characterized as relatively difficult to use for novice searchers.  The Gateway+ search engine has been designed to eliminate boolean complexity and still allow the end user to use it in sophisticated ways.</p>

<p>The plus (+) in Gateway+ stands for what is called faceted searching.  Faceted searching is a mechanism for combining the attributes of searching and browsing into a single process.  A Gateway+ search begins like any other simple Web search engine search&#150;i.e., a Google<sup>&reg;</sup>-like search&#150; by entering a brief text string that describes the information need.<p>

<p>Generally, the results of the Gateway+ text query is a fairly large (sometimes very large) retrieval set.  When a user inputs a simple text query such as "earth fire water air", the terms are executed with a boolean "or".  At this time (and with the exceptions noted in the table below), boolean operators are not supported in the free text query box.  When the user adds selections from the GEM subject drop-down menus or from the grade level selection buttons, those facets of the search are combined using the boolean "and".   </p> 

<p>Usually, but not always, the second phase of the faceted search is to begin narrowing down the retrieval set based on various facets of the resources in that set.  For example, one facet of the records in the retrieval set is their "Resource Type"&#150;i.e., some may be lesson plans, others are activities, and still others may be applets and computer applications.</p>

<p>At the top of each retrieval set returned by Gateway+ is a set of facets and clickable terms under each facet that have been derived from the retrieval set.  So, for example, an end user that is only interested in looking at lesson plans can reduce the set of retrieved resources to only lesson plans by clicking on the term in the facet list for Resource Type.  In like fashion, picking the term Parents from the Audience element will reduce the retrieval set even further to only those resources that are lesson plans and useful for parents.  This form of browsing&#150;burrowing down into the retrieval set&#150;may be continued until the retrieval set contains only those resources that fit the desired facet choices of interest.</p>

<p>When retrieval sets are displayed to the user, the sequence of records in the display (i.e., relevance ranking) is a function of weighting the terms in the query based on the elements in which they occur.  Thus, query terms are given weight in the descending order of the following elements: keywords, subject, title, description, anywhere else.</p>
