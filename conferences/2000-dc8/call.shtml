    <p align="left">DC-8 Dates and Venue:</p>

    <p align="left">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, in
    conjunction with the National<br />
     Library of Canada, the IFLA UDT program, and OCLC, is pleased
    to announce<br />
     the 8th Dublin Core Metadata Workshop, to be held:</p>

    <p align="left">October 4-6, 2000</p>

    <p align="left">National Library of Canada<br />
     Ottawa, Canada</p>

    <p align="left">Who Should Participate:</p>

    <p align="left">Previous workshops have attracted librarians,
    museum informatics<br />
     specialists, archivists, digital library researchers,
    government information<br />
     providers, publishers, and content specialists from a broad
    cross-section of<br />
     sectors and disciplines. Participants are expected to be
    familiar with<br />
     Dublin Core basics and should have expertise and interest in
    advancing the<br />
     state of Dublin Core standards or deployment. Representatives
    of other<br />
     metadata initiatives or standards interested in liaison with
    DCMI are also<br />
     encouraged to participate.</p>

    <p align="left">Agenda:</p>

    <p align="left">The 8th Dublin Core workshop affords the
    opportunity for practitioners,<br />
     theoreticians, systems developers and metadata administrators
    to meet to<br />
     discuss implementation issues, share perspectives and
    experiences, and<br />
     contribute to the evolution of the standard through working
    group meetings<br />
     and plenary discussions.</p>

    <p align="left">The specifics of the agenda will be determined
    by a steering committee as<br />
     the workshop approaches, however major themes that will be
    developed at DC 8<br />
     include:<br />
     - Issues in multi-lingual metadata<br />
     - Policies and functional requirements for metadata
    registries<br />
     - Structured representation (eg., agent descriptions for<br />
     Creator, Contributor, and Publisher elements)<br />
     - Creation and management of name authority structures<br />
     - Extending Dublin Core metadata for Domain-specific metadata
    entities</p>

    <p align="left"><br />
     Registration Dates and Deadlines:</p>

    <p align="left">Previous DC meetings have been by invitation,
    however DC-8 will be open<br />

    number is<br />
     reached.</p>

    <p align="left">Registration must be completed online via the
    Workshop Registration Page<br />
     unless special arrangements are made with the organizers. All
    participants,<br />
     whether receiving a travel stipend or not, must pay the
    registration fee<br />
     unless alternate arrangements have been made with the
    organizers. Preferred<br />
     payment is by VISA or MasterCard, though cheques, money
    orders, and bank<br />
     transfers can be accommodated. Please note that registration
    is not<br />

    additional fee of<br />
     $50 USD.</p>

    <p align="left">Visas and Letters of Invitation:</p>

    <p align="left">Determining specific requirements or
    restrictions for entry into Canada is<br />
     the responsibility of the participant. In cases where special
    arrangements<br />
     must be made, the Workshop organizers will arrange for letters
    of invitation<br />
     to be sent to appropriate embassy officials, but such requests
    must be made<br />
     45 days in advance to assure timely completion of such
    arrangements.</p>

    <p align="left">Travel Stipends:</p>

    <p align="left">There will be a limited amount of travel
    assistance available to defray the<br />
     cost of attendance for participants who would otherwise be
    unable to attend.<br />
     As with previous workshops, participants or their institutions
    should expect<br />
     to pay the majority of the costs of attendance. Individuals
    with special<br />
     circumstances that mitigate in favor of larger subsidies
    should contact the<br />
     organizers directly with justification for the need.</p>
