<h2 align="center">CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>

<p align="center">DC-2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON<br />DUBLIN CORE AND METADATA APPLICATIONS:</p> 

<p align="center"><strong>"Application Profiles: Theory and Practice"</strong></p>

<p align="center">27-31 August 2007, Singapore<br /><a href="http://conferences.nlb.gov.sg/dc2007/">http://conferences.nlb.gov.sg/dc2007/</a></p>

<p>The annual Dublin Core conferences bring together leading metadata researchers and professionals from around the world.
The 2006 conference in Manzanillo, Mexico attracted 234 participants from 25 countries. DC-2007 in Singapore will be
the seventh in a series of conferences previously held in Tokyo (2001), Florence (2002), Seattle (2003), Shanghai (2004),
Madrid (2005), and Manzanillo, Mexico (2006).</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Conference Theme:</strong></h3>  

<p>The DC-2007 theme focuses on the theory and practice of developing application profiles. Application profiles provide the means
to document the use of metadata terms within specific contexts and to combine terms from disparate namespaces. Application profiles
may apply to communities of practice (e.g. cooperation projects) as well as to organizations in the public and private sectors.
Emerging experience in the creation of application profiles reveals layers of complexity involved in combining terms from mixed
abstract models.  DC-2007 seeks to explore the conceptual and practical issues in the development and deployment of application
profiles to meet the needs of specific communities of practice.</p>

<p>In addition to contributions focusing on the DC-2007 conference theme, papers and workshop proposals are welcome on a wide range
of metadata topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Business Models for Metadata</li>
<li>Conceptual Models</li>
<li>Cross-domain Processes (e.g., Recordkeeping, Preservation, Institutional Repositories)</li>
<li>Domain Metadata (e.g., Commerce, Corporate/Enterprise, Cultural Heritage Institutions (Museums, Libaries, and Archives), Education,
Geo-Spatial, Government, Social Spaces)</li>
<li>Metadata Generation Processes (e.g., Human, Automatic, and Hybrid)</li>
<li>Metadata Harvesting</li>
<li>Multilingual Issues</li>
<li>Interoperability</li>
<li>Knowledge Organization Systems (e.g., Ontologies, Taxonomies, and Thesauri)</li>
<li>Localization and Internationalization</li>
<li>Normalization and Crosswalks</li>
<li>Quality and Evaluation</li>
<li>Registries and Registry Services</li>
<li>Search Engines and Metadata</li>
<li>Social Tagging</li>
</ul>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Paper Categories:</strong></h3> 

<p>All paper submissions to the Conference Proceedings are peer reviewed by the International Program Committee. The Committee is soliciting
paper contributions of the following two types:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Full Papers (8 to 10 pages).</strong> Full papers either describe innovative original work in detail or provide critical,
well-referenced overviews of key developments or good practice in the areas outlined above.  Full papers will be assessed
using the following criteria:
<ul>
     <li>Originality of the approach to implementation</li>
     <li>Generalizability of the methods and results described</li>
     <li>Quality of the contribution to the implementation community</li>
     <li>Significance of the results presented</li>
     <li>Clarity of presentation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Project Reports (3 to 5 pages).</strong>  Project reports describe a specific model, application, or activity in a concise,
prescribed format.  Project reports will be assessed using the following criteria:
<ul>
     <li>Conciseness and completeness of technical description</li>
     <li>Usability of the technical description by other potential implementers</li>
     <li>Clarity of presentation</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Paper submissions in both categories must be in English and will be published in both the print and the official electronic versions
of the conference proceedings. Accepted papers must be presented in Singapore by at least one of their authors.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<h3 align="center"><strong>Workshop Proposals:</strong></h3> 

<p><strong>Workshop Proposals (1 page).</strong>  Workshop proposals define the topic of a workshop session at the conference, identify
session organizers, and describe a process for inviting and reviewing contributions.</p>

<hr width="50%">

<h3 align="center"><strong>Online Submission:</strong></h3>
