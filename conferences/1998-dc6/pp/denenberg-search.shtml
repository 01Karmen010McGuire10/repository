      <h3>The Search breakout group met the afternoon of Tuesday,
      November 3.</h3>

      <p align="left"><strong>The group developed the following
      action items.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div align="left">
      <p>1. Define functional requirements for Dublin Core
      searching.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">
        However, before doing so:
      </div>

      <div align="left">
        <br />
        1.1_ Articulate what are the inadequacies of Internet
        searching (and Web searching in particular) that need to be
        solved.<br />
        1.2_ Define the audience for these requirements: vendors,
        standards developers, users?<br />
        1.3_ And define just who the users are. Are we developing
        requirements for "power" users or just recreational/casual
        users, or both?<br />
        1.4_ Determine whether or not there should be a working
        group to develop search requirements. (Note: subsequently,
        at the Wednesday plenary session, "Search" was listed among
        the working groups to be formed. Presumably that group will
        address search requirements.)<br />
        1.5_ Answer the following preliminary questions:<br />
        1.5.1 Which DC elements are access points? All of
        them?<br />
        1.5.2 Does DC searching apply to unqualified DC, qualified
        DC, or both? This question corresponds closely to 1.3
        above.<br />
        1.6 Develop user scenarios for
        searching/discovery/navigation/browsing. First, however,
        develop working definitions for these concepts (search,
        discovery, navigation, browsing) and their
        inter-relationships.<br />
        1.7 Define requirements for cross-domain searching. Do DC
        search requirements include cross-domain searching?
        Describe the differences between and similarities among DC
        searching and cross-domain searching.
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">2. After defining requirements, answer the
      following:</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">
        2.1 Is there a requirement for a DC search service
        definition?
      </div>

      <div align="left">
        2.2 Does a DC search service definition assume an abstract
        layer? For example, are DC access points "abstract" access
        points (as in the Z39.50 model)? And if so, to what extent
        are we to be concerned about mappings of abstract to real
        access points?
      </div>

      <div align="left">
        2.3 Is retrieval within the scope of a search definition?
        Or can a search definition be developed independent of
        retrieval considerations? Discussion:
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <div align="center">
      <p align="left">In the Z39.50 model, search and retrieval are
      very clearly distinguished: In the search phase of a
      search/retrieval scenario, the client sends a query to the
      server and asks the server to (a) identify records that meet
      the criteria specified by the query, (b) create a (local)
      result set corresponding to the records, and (c) report the
      number of records. In the retrieval phase, the client
      requests the server to send one or more of the records that
      were identified in the search phase. However, even though
      there are distinct models for search and retrieval, the two
      models are closely related; for example, both rely on the
      concept of a result set.</p>

      <p align="left">Thus the question is: must a DC search
      definition consider matters such as element selection (for
      example, to retrieve metadata only, or even selected
      metadata) and record syntax? Or might a simple model suffice,
      where only record pointers are retrieved, and real retrieval
      is declared out-of-scope?</p>

      <p align="left">3. Develop a working a definition of
      Interoperability as it pertains to searching, and define
      meaningful levels of interoperability. The Search breakout
      group suggested the following: "syntactic", "semantic", and
      "content", as levels of interoperability. Develop guidelines
      for each defined level of interoperability.</p>

      <p align="left">4. Though the breakout group was not tasked
      with suggesting requirements, a few very basic requirements
      came up as a by-product of discussion and the group could not
      resist listing them. (Please note that the group did not
      spend time trying to brainstorm requirements so this is by no
      means an exhaustive list of basic requirements.)</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <div align="left">
        4.1 Some sort of "Explain" facility, allowing a client to
        determine what search capabilities are supported on a
        server.<br />
        4.2 Fielded Searching.<br />
        4.3 Boolean searching.<br />
        4.4 Ranking. (Note that in the discussion of ranking,
        de-duplication was discussed but there was no consensus on
        listing it.)<br />
