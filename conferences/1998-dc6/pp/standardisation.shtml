    <p>I. Why standardise Dublin Core?</p>

    <p>1. To stabilise</p>

    <p>There is a sense of instability in the current definition of
    the Dublin Core among organisations that want to start
    implementing. Organisations directly involved in the Dublin
    Core activity have started implementing in the understanding
    that the definitions were open to change as a result of their
    experiences. Other organisations, however, are waiting for a
    stable situation before they start investing substantial
    amounts of effort and money in<br />
     creating Dublin Core metadata. Standardising the Dublin Core
    would (a) clearly mark a stable version of the agreements and
    (b) make the process of change verifiable.</p>

    <p>2. To ratify</p>

    <p>Some organisations are required to use (international)
    standards for their activities. Examples are government
    agencies who are bound by public procurement policies. Being
    able to refer to an international standard for metadata would
    give them a tool to implement and/or procure products that
    conform to this standard. In relation to this, it was mentioned
    that standardising DC could help in ISO 9000 compliance.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>II. What should be standardised?</p>

    <p>1. The current state of the consensus described in RFC 2413
    (now referred to as version 1.0) is the clear candidate to act
    as the basis for international standardisation as this is the
    version that has currently been implemented by a large number
    of projects. This version will therefore be proposed as input
    for the standardisation process.</p>

    <p>2. It is true that there are still discussions over the
    semantics of some of the elements in version 1.0. In DC-6, a
    short-term action was agreed to tidy up the definitions of
    version 1.0. This will lead to DC version 1.1, with the same 15
    elements as version 1.0, but with clarified descriptions. Given
    the intended timescale for this (3 months?), it is likely that
    version 1.1 can be injected in the standards process, together
    with any other ballot<br />
     comments, before a standard is ratified.</p>

    <p>3. The standardisation of version 2.0 that is under
    construction can be progressed as a new version of the DC
    standard probably at the end of 1999 at the earliest.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>III. Where can DC 1.0 be standardised?</p>

    <p>There are various options for standardisation of Dublin
    Core. Candidate standardisation bodies that have been
    identified are:<br />
     (a) ISO, the International Organisation for
    Standardisation<br />
     (b) CEN/ISSS, the Information Society Standardization System
    of the European Committee for Standardization<br />
     (c) NISO, the US National Information Standards
    Organization</p>

    <p>A parallel approach is proposed, submitting DC 1.0 as a work
    item to the three bodies at the same time, addressing it
    to:<br />
     1. ISO TC46/SC4/WG7<br />
     2. CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia Information
    (MMI) for adoption as a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA)<br />
     3. NISO Standards Development Committee</p>

    <p>The timescale of the standardisation process depends on
    the<br />
     established procedures of the three bodies. Of course,
    the<br />
     proposal has to go through these procedures, although wherever
    possible, a fast-track option will be pursued. Hopefully, the
    ballot process for all three tracks can be well underway at the
    time of DC-7 in Frankfurt.</p>

    <p>In any case, there was a consensus in the break-out session
    that the DC community would retain "ownership" of DC, so that,
    for example, it would be the DC process and not any external
    standards organisation that would control changes.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>IV. What could be problems in the process?</p>

    <p>Three issues were identified:</p>

    <p>1. Copyright issues<br />
     All of the standardisation bodies have certain policies
    towards copyright on the standards they publish. A solution can
    be proposed where the standards bodies have shared copyright,
    which allows them to sell the standard document, whereas the
    Dublin Core Metadata Initiative at the same time should retain
    the rights on making the content freely available on the Web. A
    similar solution has been found between ISO, NISO and the
    Z39.50 maintenance agency<br />
     concerning the Z39.50 standard.</p>

    <p>2. Document format<br />
     All of the standardisation bodies have certain rules
    pertaining to the layout and format of published standards.
    There should be a certain flexibility, provided that the core
    body of the standard is identical. An example of this is again
    the Z39.50 standard where the content of the ISO and NISO
    standard documents is identical.</p>

    <p>3. Maintenance agency<br />
     In any case, the responsible body for the maintenance of the
    content of DC should be a more-or-less formalised maintenance
    agency much like the Z39.50 Maintenance Agency supported by the
    Z39.50 Implementers Group is responsible for the maintenance of
    Z39.50. The proposals for the Organization and Process of the
    Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (Directorate, Technical and
    Policy Advisory Committees, and DC Workshops) should lead to a
    similar<br />
     identifiable maintenance agency.</p>
