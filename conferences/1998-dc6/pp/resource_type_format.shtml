    <h1 align="left">DC-6 Resource Type and Format breakout</h1>

    <h3 align="left">The focus of the breakout was</h3>

    <p align="left"><em>(1) examining how the DCQ structured data
    model, with its element and value qualifiers, can be used for
    the Type and<br />
     Format elements in DC</em></p>

    <p align="left"><em>(2) teasing out the proper semantics of
    Type, in particular clarifying its relationship with
    Format.</em></p>

    <p align="left">This breakout group had the advantage, or
    possibly baggage, of corresponding to an existing DC working
    group. Thus, a deal of background work was available. However,
    while many of those present had a strong background in some of
    the issues because of this, there were a number of people at
    the breakout who were coming relatively new to the issues and
    had to be brought up to speed as possible.</p>

    <p align="left">The working group had in particular been
    wrestling with proposals for controlled vocabularies or list of
    terms to be used as recommended in the RFC:</p>

    <h3 align="left">"For the sake of interoperability, Type|Format
    should be selected from a list that is currently under
    development in the workshop series."<br />
    </h3>

    <p align="left"><strong>Format</strong></p>

    <p align="left">For Format it has generally been accepted that
    <strong>digital</strong> resources can be adequately described
    using IMT or MIME types. This obviates the need for the DC
    community to maintain a list or vocabulary.</p>

    <p align="left">One outstanding issue in this, however, is the
    requirement<br />
    sometimes to indicate nested formats, exemplified by the
    case<br />
    of compressed formats which in turn contain data in
    another<br />
    special format. A further form of nesting is exemplified<br />
    by a CD-ROM (ie a piece of plastic), containing an<br />
    ISO-#### digital data stream, which in turn contains
    files<br />
    of various MIME types. The problem here really comes down<br />
    to application of the 1:1 principle</p>

    <p align="left">However, with the extension of DC to also cover
    non-digital resources, the solution is less clear. In the
    generalised usage, the Format element can be used in the sense
    of "form of instantiation for operational purposes". This
    should cover the "museum's" requirements for a "physical
    description". For this usage there are a number of vocabularies
    or coding systems available, such as the Getty Art and
    Architecture Thesaurus Physical Media. The particular
    vocabulary used for any instance may be indicated using the DCQ
    value qualifier, also known as "scheme".</p>

    <p align="left">Another outstanding issue for the Format
    element is the requirement to encode size information in
    addition to media. Size clearly represents a particular usage
    of the Format element which probably requires the element to be
    qualified, ie a Format "type" of "size", in contrast to another
    Format "type" of "media" or similar. Furthermore, for many
    resources several different measurements of size can be made,
    so capturing this in a machine-readable way will require some
    structuring or qualification of the element and content. This
    was not explored in the breakout.</p>

    <p align="left">Most outstanding questions related to the
    Format element appear to be largely engineering issues which
    can be accommodated by convention within the DCQ structure.</p>

    <h3 align="left">Type</h3>

    <p align="left">Discussions around Type were much more
    contentious. In particular, there is still a lot of confusion
    about the distinction between Type and Format.</p>

    <p align="left">The generalised definition of Format given
    above ("form of instantiation for operational purposes")
    appears to successfully capture a useful semantic for Format,
    and thus imply what Type does not cover.</p>

    <p align="left">The existing definition of Type refers to the
    "genre" of the resource, and has been generally understood well
    in relation to information resources.</p>

    <p align="left">Genre terms such as "novel", "poem", etc are
    quoted in the definition of Type in the current RFC. Several
    very rich vocubularies are available for these from the
    communities dealing with bibliographic information, and also
    for education and art. Terms from these vocabularies may be
    used for Type, with the source indicated using a DCQ value
    qualifier or "scheme". Of course the use of domain-specific
    vocabularies will limit semantic interoperability.</p>

    <p align="left">However, the notion of "genre" is more
    problematic in the expanded universe to be described by DC
    which includes things other than information resources.</p>

    <h3 align="left">A "minimalist" list of values for Type</h3>

    <p align="left">(the cross-domain 8 or XD8) has been developed
    by<br />
    the working group, to fulfill the requirement<br />
    from the RFC quoted above, as follows:<br />
    text<br />
    image<br />
    sound<br />
    dataset<br />
    software<br />
    interactive<br />
    event<br />
    physical object</p>

    <p align="left">This list has the benefit of attempting to be
    fully cross-domain, and is also simple (short!) enough to be
    generally used. However, an inspection of the XD8 reveals that
    it is strongly biased with much finer granularity for
    information resources in the first six items (the I6), and then
    a rump of two ("event" and "physical object") for all other
    resources (the O2).</p>

    <h3 align="left">However, there were questions about</h3>

    <p align="left">(a) whether the granularity in the I6, though
    finer than in the O2, was in fact useful for any particular
    real-world application,<br />
    (b) whether the specific terms in the O2 are comprehensive
    (unlikely, especially in view of the absence of a fall-through
    value of "other")<br />
    (c) what was the basis for privileging the O2 over other
    possible non-information-resource terms (special pleading was
    suggested!),<br />
    (d) (in particular) whether the aspect of the property
    distinguished between the I6 was followed through in the rest
    of the list.</p>

    <p align="left">A number of other requirements were also raised
    as requiring additional attention. These included</p>

    <p align="left">(1) the need to distinguish between
    "collections" and "items" (particularly important for
    archivists): since more-or-less all resources can occur in
    either form, this appears to be a distinction approximately
    orthogonal to other genre indications, and thus may be
    accommodated through DCQ qualification of the Type element with
    a "type=aggregation-level", in contrast to the
    "type=genre";</p>

    <p align="left">(2) needs for Type values of "abstract work",
    "service", "moving-image".</p>

    <p align="left">The specific requirements could be seen in some
    cases to emanate mainly from specific communities. In fact,
    recognising the functional needs of specific domains is often
    the key to understanding the basis for arguments around the
    Type element. Different communities have different views of the
    world driven by their particular requirements, which may in
    fact require different solutions, equally valid in context.</p>

    <p align="left">Clearly some work remains to be done in
    cleaning up the semantics of the Type element, even before
    proceeding to recommendations and the engineering issues. It is
    likely that some pragmatic compromise and "rules-of-thumb" will
    be needed.</p>
    <hr />

    <p align="left">The problems in both Format and Type appear to
    have been incited by the generalisation of DC to describe
    non-digital resources, and in particular, non-information
    resources. A particular consequence of this has been to muddy
    the 1:1 issue which appears to particular confuse the use of
    the Type and Format elements.<br />
