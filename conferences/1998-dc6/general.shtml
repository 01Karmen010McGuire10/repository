    </div>

    <p align="left">The Dublin Core Metadata Invitational Workshop
    Series began in March of 1995, convening a broad range of
    information professionals to address the problem of improving
    resource discovery on the Internet. The present workshop is the
    6th in the series. The goal of this sixth workshop is to
    consolidate developments of various Dublin Core working groups,
    to share implementation experiences and strategies of existing
    pilot implementations, and to address key issues necessary to
    promote interoperability among Dublin Core implementations.</p>

    <p align="left">The workshop will convene at 9:00 AM on Monday,
    November 2 at the Library of Congress in Washington DC and will
    continue until mid-day on Wednesday, November 4.</p>

    <p align="left">The field of participants has been established
    by review by the organizing committee of nominations (self and
    otherwise).</p>
