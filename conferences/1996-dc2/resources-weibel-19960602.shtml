    <h1>A Proposed Convention for Embedding Metadata in HTML</h1>

    <h2>Reported by Stuart Weibel (weibel@oclc.org)</h2>

    <p>June 2, 1996</p>

    <p>The following proposed convention reflects the consensus of
    a break-out group at the W3C Distributed Indexing and Searching
    Workshop, May 28-29, 1996, concerning tagging of meta
    information in HTML. This break out group included
    representatives of the Dublin Core/Warwick Framework Metadata
    meetings, Lycos, Microsoft, WebCrawler, the IEEE metadata
    effort, Verity Software, and the W3C.</p>

    <h3><br />
    1. THE PROBLEM</h3>

    <p>The problem is to identify a simple means of embedding
    metadata within HTML documents without requiring additional
    tags or changes to browser software, and without unnecessarily
    compromising current practices for robot collection of
    data.</p>

    <p>While metadata is intended for display in some situations,
    it is judged undesireable for such embedded metadata to display
    on browser screens as a side effect of displaying a document.
    Therefore, any solution requires encoding information in
    attribute tags rather than as container element content.</p>

    <p>The goal was to agree on a simple convention for encoding
    structured metadata information of a variety of types (which
    may or may not be registered with a central registry analogous
    to the Mime Type registry). It was judged that a registry may
    be a necessary feature of the metadata infrastructure as
    alternative schema are elaborated, but that deployment in the
    short-term<br />
    could go forward without such a registry, especially in light
    of the proposed use of the LINK tag to link descriptions to a
    standard schema description as described below.</p>

    <h3>2. A PROPOSED CONVENTION</h3>

    <p>The solution agreed upon is to encode schema elements in
    META tags, one element per META tag, and as many META tags as
    are necessary. Grouping of schema elements is achieved by a
    prefix schema identifier associated with each schema
    element.</p>

    <p>The convention agreed upon is as follows:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;META NAME    = "schema_identifier.element_name"
<br />
CONTENT = "string data"&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Thus, a partial Dublin Core citation might be encoded as
    follows:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;META NAME    = "DC.title"
<br />
CONTENT = "HTML 2.0 Specification"&gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "DC.author"
<br />
CONTENT = "Tim Berners-Lee"&gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "DC.author"
<br />
CONTENT = "Dan Connolly"&gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "DC.date"
<br />
CONTENT = "November, 1995"&gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "DC.identifier"
<br />
CONTENT = "ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1866.txt"&gt;
</pre>

    <p>And a collection of Microsoft Word metadata might be encoded
    as follows:</p>
<pre>
     &lt;META NAME    = "MSW.title"
<br />
CONTENT = "W3C Indexing Work Shop Report"&gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "MSW.author"
<br />
CONTENT = "Wick Nichols &gt;
<br />
<br />
&lt;META NAME    = "MSW.date"
<br />
CONTENT = "May 30, 1996"&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>3. LINKAGE TO THE REFERENCE DESCRIPTION OF A METADATA
    SCHEMA</h3>

    <p>It is judged useful to provide a means for linking to the
    reference definition of the metadata schema (or schemata) used
    in a document. Doing so serves as a primitive registration
    mechanism for metadata schemata, and lays the foundation for a
    more formal, machine-readable linkage mechanism in the future.
    The proposed convention for doing so is as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;LINK REL = SCHEMA.schema_identifier HREF="URL"&gt;
</pre>

    <p>Thus, the reference description of one metadata scheme, the
    Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, would be referenced in the
    LINK HREF as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;LINK REL = SCHEMA.dc HREF = "http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core"&gt;
</pre>

    <p>The description of an element could be accessed by the
    construction of URL using the # token to identify a named
    anchor. Thus, the derived URL below actually links to the title
    element in the reference description of the Dublin Core
    Metadata Element Set.</p>
<pre>
http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements#title
</pre>

    <p>This URL would correspond to the human-readable description
    of the title element within the document by a NAME anchor such
    as:</p>
<pre>
&lt;A NAME = "title"&gt; Title &lt;/A&gt;

   The name of the work provided by the author or publisher.
</pre>

    <p>While use of the LINK tag is not required for a given
    schema, when used, it will make possible retrieval of the
    reference definition of a given schema element, and will
    therefore reduce the need for a formal metadata scheme
    registry. Multiple LINK tags can be used so that elements
    derived from multiple schemas can be referenced within a single
    document.</p>

    <h3>4. CONSISTENCY OF DESCRIPTION SCHEMAS</h3>

    <p>To promote consistency among resource description schemas,
    it is suggested that the semantics for metadata elements be
    related to existing well-known schemas whenever feasible.</p>
