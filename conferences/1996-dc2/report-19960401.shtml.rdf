   <dc:title>A Syntax for Dublin Core Metadata: Recommendations from the Second Metadata Workshop</dc:title>
   <dc:description>This document summarizes a set of recommendations concerning 
                the representation of metadata, derived from discussion within 
                the syntax working group which met at the second Metadata Workshop, 
                held at Warwick University in April 1996. The discussion begun 
                in Warwick has been continued electronically by the current authors, 
                and this paper presents both the recommendations agreed on by 
                the syntax working group in Warwick and some further developments 
                for which the authors alone are responsible.</dc:description>
