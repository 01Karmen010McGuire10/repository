    <h2 align="center">Metadata Workshop II</h2>

    <p align="left">April 1 - 3, 1996<br />
    <a href="http://www.csv.warwick.ac.uk/">University of
    Warwick</a>, UK<br />
    </p>
    <hr />

    <p>The Second Invitational Metadata Workshop is intended to
    broaden the scope of the effort begun in March of 1995 at the
    OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop. The first meeting convened a mix
    of computer science, text markup, and library professionals who
    achieved consensus concerning a simple resource description
    record that may serve as a foundation for unifying various
    network resource description models.</p>

    <p>Substantial interest in this approach has developed in
    digital library efforts around the world, including the US
    Digital Library Initiative projects, JISC's Electronic
    Libraries Programme in the UK, an emerging digital library
    initiative under the auspices of the ERCIM consortium of
    European National Laboratories, and in related efforts by the
    national libraries of Australia and New Zealand.</p>

    <p>The second workshop is intended to explore deployment
    strategies that will improve prospects for semantic
    interoperability on a global basis and across discipline
    boundaries.</p>

    <p>The first workshop targeted the semantic content of a simple
    description record. The focus of the second workshop will be to
    build upon this foundation to identify implementation
    strategies that will serve two main purposes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>promote semantic interoperability across disciplines and
      languages, and</li>

      <li>define mechanisms for extensibility to support richer
      description and linkages to other description models.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>When:</strong> April 1 - 3, 1996</p>

    <p><strong>Location:</strong> University of Warwick, UK</p>

    <p><strong>Venue:</strong> The workshop will take place from
    1st to 3rd April 1996 inclusive at Radcliffe House, University
    of Warwick. Designed in 1986, at the edge of the University of
    Warwick campus, Radcliffe House blends the comfort and services
    of a quality hotel with modern conference facilities. The
    Centre has a large lounge and bar area and there is an exercise
    room. Delegates may also use the university sports facilities
    and will find excellent walks in the campus grounds.</p>

    <p>The campus is situated in Warwickshire countryside
    approximately 5 miles from Coventry, 8 miles from Warwick, 12
    miles from Birmingham and 25 miles from Stratford-upon-Avon.
    Birmingham International Airport is about 12 miles from the
    campus and the train journey from Birmingham New Street station
    to Coventry takes approximately 30 minutes. The journey time
    from London Euston to Coventry station is approximately 75
    minutes. Taxis from Coventry station (which is the nearest for
    the campus) take about 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>If delegates wish to extend their stay after the conference,
    suitable hotels will be found nearby in Warwick, Coventry or
    Stratford-upon Avon.</p>
