<h1>Call for Proposals: DC-2009 Conference Tutorials</h1>
<p>Proposals are invited from anyone interested in delivering tutorials at the <a href="http://www.dc2009.kr/">Dublin Core 2009 Conference</a>
to be held in Seoul, Korea from 12 to 16 October 2009. We wish to include both <a href="#introductory">Introductory</a> and
<a href="#advanced">Advanced</a> tutorials in the programme, and would welcome proposals in both categories, as described below.</p>

<hr />

<a name="introductory" id="introductory"></a>
<h2>Introductory Tutorials</h2>

<p>A half-day introductory tutorial stream is envisaged for the Monday before the main conference (12 October 2009).
It is expected that this will be comprised of two sessions of two hours.
The purpose of this stream is to give new participants a thorough grounding in the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.
In particular, the tutorials should cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="/about/">development and focus of DCMI</a></li>
<li>the <a href="/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a></li>
<li>the <a href="/documents/abstract-model/">DCMI Abstract Model</a>, its role and key concepts</li>
<li>the <a href="/documents/singapore-framework/">Singapore Framework</a>, and the development and use of Dublin Core Application Profiles</li>
</ul>

<p>Support for attendance will be provided to presenters of introductory tutorials.
Proposals are invited from individuals, indicating the topics they would cover, relevant experience, and the learning approach.
Joint proposals covering the all the desired material are particularly encouraged.</p>

<hr />

<a name="advanced" id="advanced"></a>
<h2>Advanced Tutorials</h2>

<p>DC-2009 will focus on linked data and the enabling of the Semantic Web.
Conference participants will explore the conceptual and practical issues in breaking the constraints of data silos and connecting pieces of data,
information, and knowledge.  Proposals for advanced tutorials are invited that would explore practice issues related to this theme.
It is envisaged that advanced tutorials would be offered twice, on the Monday (12 October 2009) and Friday (16 October 2009),
and proposals for both half and full day tutorials are welcome.
No direct support will be provided to advanced tutorial presenters, but revenue will be split between the Conference and the presenters.
(Registration for half day tutorials will be US$100, for full day tutorials US$200).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Submission and selection process</h2>

<p>The language for all tutorials will be English. Proposals should be submitted by 15 May 2009 to the Tutorial Chairs,
<a href="mailto:john.roberts@archives.govt.nz">John Roberts</a>  and <a href="mailto:heesop@mail.knu.ac.kr">Heesop Kim</a>.

Please feel free to contact us with any queries regarding this call.</p>

<p>Successful proposals will be advised by 22 June 2009, in line with notification of paper acceptance for the main conference.
It is expected that tutorial presenters will provide handout materials by 11 September 2009 in time for copying and inclusion
in conference material for delegates. Authors of tutorial materials need to agree to grant DCMI a perpetual, non-exclusive licence
to use, copy and distribute the material and/or create adaptations or derivatives from the material in any medium for any purpose
