    <h2>1.0 Executive Summary</h2>

    <p>The March 1995 Metadata Workshop, sponsored by the Online
    Computer Library Center (OCLC) and the National Center for
    Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), convened 52 selected
    researchers and professionals from librarianship, computer
    science, text encoding, and related areas, to advance the state
    of the art in the development of resource description (or
    metadata) records for networked electronic information
    objects.</p>

    <h3>1.1 Goals</h3>

    <p>Goals of the workshop included (1) fostering a common
    understanding of the needs, strengths, shortcomings, and
    solutions of the stakeholders; and (2) reaching consensus on a
    core set of metadata elements to describe networked
    resources.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>

    <p>The size and complexity of the resource description problem
    required limiting the scope of deliberations. Given that the
    majority of current networked information objects are
    recognizably "documents", and that the metadata records are
    immediately needed to facilitate resource discovery on the
    Internet, the proposed set of metadata elements (The Dublin
    Core) is intended to describe the essential features of
    electronic documents that support resource discovery. Other
    important metadata elements, such as those describing cost
    accounting or archiving information, were excluded from
    consideration. It was recognized that these elements might be
    included in a more complete record that could be derived from
    the Dublin Core by a well-defined extension.</p>

    <h3>1.3 The Intended Niche</h3>

    <p>The Dublin Core is not intended to supplant other resource
    descriptions, but rather to complement them. There are
    currently two types of resource descriptions for networked
    electronic documents: automatically generated indexes used by
    locator services such as Lycos and WebCrawler; and cataloging
    records, such as MARC, created by professional information
    providers. Automatically generated records often contain too
    little information to be useful, while manually generated
    records are too costly to create and maintain for the large
    number of electronic documents currently available on the
    Internet. Records created from the Dublin Core are intended to
    mediate these extremes, affording a simple structured record
    that may be enhanced or mapped to more complex records as
    called for, either by direct extension or by a link to a more
    elaborate record.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Next Steps</h3>

    <p>The work of the 1995 workshop is one of a series of steps
    being taken to improve the description of networked information
    objects. A Metadata Workshop Steering Committee is being formed
    to extend the work of the March 1995 Workshop through a series
    of similar activities that will bring together stakeholder
    communities to focus on discrete parts of the larger problem.
    As with the initial workshop, promoting effective communication
    among the communities will be a primary goal. The diversity of
    implementation efforts influenced by the Dublin Core testifies
    to the benfits of such communication, and promises to help
    integrate related activities among librarians, the Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF), text encoding researchers, and
    other researchers who have substantial investments in resource
    description.</p>

    <h2>2.0 Introduction</h2>

    <p>The explosive growth of interest in the Internet and the
    World Wide Web in the past five years has created a digital
    extension of the academic research library for certain kinds of
    materials. Valuable collections of texts, images and sounds
    from many scholarly communities--collections that may even be
    the subject of state-of-the-art discussions in these
    communities--now exist only in electronic form and may be
    accessible from the Internet. Knowledge regarding the
    whereabouts and status of this material is often passed on by
    word of mouth among members of a given community. For
    outsiders, however, much of this material is so difficult to
    locate that it is effectively unavailable.</p>

    <p>Why is it so difficult to find items of interest on the
    Internet or the World Wide Web? A number of well-designed
    locator services, such as Lycos <a
    href="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/">[http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/]</a>
    are now available that automatically index every resource
    available on the Web and maintain up-to-date databases of
    locations. But it has not yet been demonstrated that indexes
    contain sufficiently rich resource descriptions, especially if
    the location databases are large and span many fields of study.
    Moreover, a huge number of resources on the Internet have no
    description at all beyond a filename which may or may not carry
    semantic content. If these resources are to be discovered
    through a systematic search, they must be described by someone
    familiar with their intellectual content, preferably in a form
    appropriate for inclusion in a database of pointers to
    resources. But current attempts to describe electronic
    resources according to formal standards (e.g, the TEI header <a
    href="#TEI">[TEI]</a> or MARC <a href="#MARC">[MARC]</a>
    cataloging) can accomodate only a small subset of the most
    important resources.</p>

    <p>Another solution, not yet implemented, that promises to
    mediate these extremes involves the manual creation of a record
    that is more informative than an index entry but is less
    complete than a formal cataloging record. If only a small
    amount of human effort were required to create the record, more
    objects could be described, especially if the author of the
    resource could be encouraged to create the description. And if
    the description followed an established standard, only the
    creation of the record would require human intervention;
    automated tools could discover the descriptions and collect
    them into searchable databases.</p>

    <p>What should this hypothetical description contain? Put in a
    convenient jargon, the question is about
    <strong>metadata</strong>--literally, data about data--or the
    contents of a surrogate record that characterize an object.
    Thus the question can be recast more precisely: how can a
    simple metadata record be defined that sufficiently describes a
    wide range of electronic objects? Recognizing the need to
    answer this and a multitude of associated questions, the Online
    Computer Library Center (OCLC) and the National Center for
    Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) sponsored the invitational
    Metadata Workshop on March 1-3, 1995, in Dublin, Ohio.
    Fifty-two librarians, archivists, humanities scholars and
    geographers, as well as standards makers in the Internet,
    Z39.50 and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
    communities, met to identify the scope of the problem, to
    achieve consensus on a list of metadata elements that would
    yield simple descriptions of data in a wide range of subject
    areas, and to lay the groundwork for achieving further progress
    in the definition of metadata elements that describe electronic
    information. This paper reports on the progress made at that
    workshop.</p>

    <h2>3.0 The Dublin Metadata Workshop</h2>

    <p>Since the Internet will contain more information than
    professional abstractors, indexers and catalogers can manage
    using existing methods and systems, it was agreed that a
    reasonable alternative way to obtain usable metadata for
    electronic resources is to give authors and information
    providers a means to describe the resources themselves, without
    having to undergo the extensive training required to create
    records conforming to established standards. As one step toward
    realizing this goal, the major task of the Metadata Workshop
    was to identify and define a simple set of elements for
    describing networked electronic resources. To make this task
    manageable, it was limited in two ways. First, only those
    elements necessary for the discovery of the resource were
    considered. It was believed that resource discovery is the most
    pressing need that metadata can satisfy, and one that would
    have to be satisfied regardless of the subject matter or
    internal complexity of the object.</p>

    <p>The discussion was further restricted to the metadata
    elements required for the discovery of what were called
    <strong>document-like objects</strong>, or
    <strong>DLOs</strong> by the workshop participants. It was
    believed that DLOs are still the most common type of resource
    sought in the Internet and that whatever solution could be
    proposed for DLOs could be extended to other kinds of
    resources. More importantly, the likelihood of making progress
    on this challenging problem would be increased if attention
    could initially be restricted to something familiar.</p>

    <p>DLOs were not rigorously defined, but were understood by
    example. For example, an electronic version of a newspaper
    article or a dictionary is a DLO, while an unannotated
    collection of slides is not. Of course, the crux of the problem
    is that in a networked environment, DLOs can be arbitrarily
    complex because they can consist of text with callouts to
    images, audio or video clips, or to other hypertext documents.
    The participants of the Metadata Workshop made no attempt to
    limit the complexity of DLOs, except possibly to say that the
    intellectual content of a DLO is primarily text, and that the
    metadata required for describing DLOs will bear a strong
    resemblance to the metadata that describes traditional printed
    texts.</p>

    <p>As a result of the restricted focus of the workshop, certain
    issues required for a complete description of DLOs, such as
    cost, archival status and copyright information, were
    eliminated from the scope of the discussion. Elements required
    for the description of objects other than DLOs, such as the
    elements required for the description of complex geological
    strata in a geospatial resource, were also beyond the scope of
    the discussion. The goal was to define a small, universally
    understood set of metadata elements that would allow authors
    and information providers to describe their work and to
    facilitate interoperability among resource discovery tools. But
    because the core elements do not yield a description of objects
    that meets the needs of specialized user communities, careful
    consideration was also given to mechanisms for extending the
    element set.</p>

    <p>The primary deliverable from the workshop was a set of
    thirteen metadata elements, named the <strong>Dublin Metadata
    Core Element Set</strong> (or Dublin Core, for short) by the
    workshop participants. The Dublin Core was proposed as the
    minimum number of metadata elements required to facilitate the
    discovery of document-like objects in a networked environment
    such as the Internet. The syntax was deliberately left
    unspecified as an implementation detail. The semantics of these
    elements was intended to be clear enough to be understood by a
    wide range of users.</p>

    <p>Below is an introductory discussion of the elements in the
    Dublin Core</p>

    <p><strong>Element Description</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subject:</strong> The topic addressed by the
      work</li>

      <li><strong>Title:</strong> The name of the object</li>

      <li><strong>Author:</strong> The person(s) primarily
      responsible for the intellectual content of the object</li>

      <li><strong>Publisher:</strong> The agent or agency
      responsible for making the object available</li>

      <li><strong>OtherAgent:</strong> The person(s), such as
      editors and transcribers, who have made other significant
      intellectual contributions to the work</li>

      <li><strong>Date:</strong> The date of publication</li>

      <li><strong>ObjectType:</strong> The genre of the object,
      such as novel, poem, or dictionary</li>

      <li><strong>Form:</strong> The data representation of the
      object, such as Postscript file or Windows executable
      file</li>

      <li><strong>Identifier:</strong> String or number used to
      uniquely identify the object</li>

      <li><strong>Relation:</strong> Relationship to other
      objects</li>

      <li><strong>Source:</strong> Objects, either print or
      electronic, from which this object is derived, if
      applicable</li>

      <li><strong>Language:</strong> Language of the intellectual
      content</li>

      <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> The spatial locations and
      temporal durations characteristic of the object</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To make this discussion concrete, consider an electronic
    record created with the relevant portions of the Dublin Core,
    and a sample syntax, that describes an electronic version of
    Maya Angelou's poem "On the Pulse of Morning". This description
    is based on a record created by the University of Virginia
    Library's Electronic Text Center. (For a description of that
    project, see Gaynor <a href="#Gaynor">[Gaynor]</a> .)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title:</strong> On the Pulse of Morning</li>

      <li><strong>Author:</strong> Maya Angelou</li>

      <li><strong>Publisher:</strong> University of Virgina Library
      Electronic Text Center</li>

      <li><strong>OtherAgent:</strong> Transcribed by the
      University of Virginia Electronic Text Center</li>

      <li><strong>Date:</strong> 1993</li>

      <li><strong>Object:</strong> Poem</li>

      <li><strong>Form:</strong> 1 ASCII file</li>

      <li><strong>Source:</strong> Newspaper stories and oral
      performance of text at the presidential inauguration of Bill
      Clinton</li>

      <li><strong>Language:</strong> English</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although the goal of the Dublin Metadata Workshop was to
    develop a simple set of metadata elements, these elements also
    had to be defined in such a way that they could be mapped into
    more complex and highly controlled systems such as USMARC.
    These conflicting demands have been reconciled in two ways. The
    first was to create a set of metadata elements with definitions
    that could be understood easily without the need for user
    training, as well as an approach to modification that meets the
    needs of specialized communities for more precise descriptions.
    This is described in Section 5. The second was to provide
    mechanisms for extending the core element set to describe items
    other than document-like objects. These mechanisms are
    discussed in Section 6.</p>

    <p>As Guenther <a href="#Guenther">[Guenther]</a>points out, a
    small set of metadata elements such as the Dublin Core would be
    valuable for at least four reasons. First, it would encourage
    authors and publishers to provide metadata, in a form that
    automated resource discovery tools could collect it, when they
    make data available. Second, it would encourage the creation of
    network publishing tools that contain a template for metadata
    elements, further simplifying the task of creating metadata
    records. Third, a record created with the Dublin Core could
    serve as the basis for a more detailed cataloging record if the
    need arises. Finally, if something like the Dublin Core became
    a standard, metadata records could be understood across user
    communities.</p>

    <p>Since the difficult work of identifying a simple but useful
    specification for the description of networked resources has
    only begun, the major accomplishment of the Metadata Workshop
    was to define the problem and sketch out a solution. Many
    details of that solution need further refinement. Accordingly,
    one goal of this paper is to focus discussion by identifying
    the areas that need the most work. Section 7 lists the most
    pressing unresolved issues. The appendices identify further
    problems that arise when an attempt is made to formalize what
    has been proposed so far. Section 8 describes projects already
    underway that increase our understanding of how resources on
    the Internet should be described and show what is possible if a
    metadata element set such as the Dublin Core becomes a
    standard. Finally, Section 9 outlines the steps that are being
    taken to ensure that progress on this important problem
    continues to be made.</p>

    <h2>4.0 Underlying Assumptions</h2>

    <p>The discussions at the Metadata Workshop revealed several
    principles that should guide the further development of the
    element set. Adherence to these principles increases the
    likelihood that the core element set will be kept as small as
    possible, that the meanings of the elements will be understood
    by most users, and that the element set will be flexible enough
    for the description of resources in a wide range of subject
    areas. These principles are intrinsicality, extensibility,
    syntax-independence, optionality, repeatability and
    modifiability.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Intrinsicality</h3>

    <p>The Dublin Core concentrates on describing intrinsic
    properties of the object. Intrinsic data refer to the
    properties of the work that could be discovered by having the
    work in hand, such as its intellectual content and physical
    form. This is distinguished from extrinsic data, which describe
    the context in which the work is used. For example, the
    "Subject" element is intrinsic data, while transaction
    information such as cost and access considerations are
    extrinsic data. Though extrinsic data may be important for a
    complete description of an object, it is handled by the
    extension mechanisms described in Section 6.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Extensibility</h3>

    <p>In addition to its use in dealing with extrinsic data, the
    extension mechanism will allow the inclusion of intrinsic data
    for objects that cannot be adequately described by a small set
    of elements.</p>

    <p>Extensibility is important because users may wish to add
    extra descriptive material for site-specific purposes or
    specialized fields. In addition, the specification of the
    Dublin Core itself may change over time, and the extension
    mechanism allows revisions while maintaining some backward
    compatibility with the originally defined element set.</p>

    <h3>4.3 Syntax-Independence</h3>

    <p>Syntactic bindings are avoided because it is too early to
    propose formal definitions and because the Dublin Core is
    intended to be eventually used in a range of disciplines and
    application programs. The examples in Appendix I show some
    sample encodings.</p>

    <h3>4.4 Optionality</h3>

    <p>For two reasons, all the elements are optional. First, the
    Dublin Core may eventually be applied to objects for which some
    elements have no meaning. Who is the author of a satellite
    image? Second, it seems futile to mandate complex descriptions
    if the creators of the content are expected to provide the
    descriptive material. A simple description is better than no
    description at all.</p>

    <h3>4.5 Repeatability</h3>

    <p>All elements in the Dublin Core are repeatable. For example,
    multiple author elements would be used when a resource has
    multiple authors.</p>

    <h3>4.6 Modifiability</h3>

    <p>Each element in the Dublin Core has a definition that is
    intended to be self-explanatory. However, it is also necessary
    that the definitions of the elements satisfy the needs of
    different communities. This goal is accomplished by allowing
    each element to be modified by an optional qualifier. If no
    qualifier is present, the element has its common-sense meaning;
    otherwise, the definition of the element is modified by the
    value of the qualifier.</p>

    <p>Qualifiers will be typically derived from well-known
    conventions in the library community or from the field of
    knowledge appropriate to the resource. Qualifiers are important
    because they give the Dublin Core a mechanism for bridging the
    gap between casual and sophisticated users. For example, the
    data in the <strong>Subject</strong> element consists of any
    word or phrase that describes the object's content. However, a
    professional cataloger may wish to supply the name of the
    authoritative source from which the subject terms are taken. In
    such a case, the element may be written as <strong>Subject
    (scheme=LCSH)</strong>, indicating that the subject terms are
    taken from the Library of Congress Subject Headings.</p>

    <h2>5.0 A Detailed Description of the Elements in the Dublin
    Core</h2>

    <p>This section presents detailed definitions of the elements
    in the Dublin Core. The simple and informal records that would
    result from the application of this element set will help raise
    the standards of resource description without imposing the
    overhead normally associated with more exacting standards. But
    when necessary, the elements in the Dublin Core should support
    definitions that are precise enough to enable the mapping of
    records to widely used standards such as USMARC, TEI or
    FGDC.</p>

    <p>To accomplish this goal, each element in the Dublin Core can
    be qualified with a scheme. Schemes are used whenever it is
    necessary to describe the rationale for the encoding of the
    data associated with the element, such as when reference is
    made to controlled vocabulary, a well-known notation or a
    published standard. This section describes the use of schemes,
    but since qualification is still an active topic of discussion,
    other qualifiers will undoubtedly be proposed in future
    versions of the Dublin Core. See Appendix II for a sample SGML
    Document Type Definition (DTD) <a
    href="#Herwijnen">[Herwijnen]</a> that defines additional
    qualifiers for some of the elements.</p>

    <p>A comment about syntax is necessary at this point. As stated
    in Section 4.3, the elements in the Dublin Core were purposely
    defined in a syntax-independent manner. Nonetheless, providing
    examples is often the best way to communicate, so the following
    descriptions include examples represented in a simple syntax
    that might be suitable for a HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
    document. This should not be considered as the definitive
    representation, but rather as a possible representation.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Subject</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Subject</strong> is the field of knowledge to
    which the work belongs. This may be a general description of a
    broad discipline, or a series of descriptors of differing
    scope.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Subject</strong> element can be qualified by a
    scheme, which specifies adherence to a known classification
    system such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, the
    Dewey Decimal System, or the Art and Architecture Thesaurus, to
    name a few. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Subject (scheme=LCSH) = UNIX (Computer system)</li>

      <li>Subject (scheme=Dewey Decimal System)=004.251
      Supercomputers--systems design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Without the scheme, the <strong>Subject</strong> element is
    a keyword and may contain any word or phrase that describes the
    intellectual content of the object. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Subject = Network Information Discovery and
      Retrieval</li>

      <li>Subject = Information Retrieval</li>

      <li>Subject = Cataloging of Internet Resources</li>

      <li>Subject = Metadata</li>

      <li>Subject = Description of electronic resources</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Title</h3>

    <p><strong>Title</strong> is defined as the name of the object.
    Most document-like objects will have an obvious title, but if
    the Dublin Core is eventually used to describe resources such
    as satellite images or objects in a museum, there will be no
    designated character string that is understood as a title. A
    descriptive phrase might be appropriate instead. For
    example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Title = Statistical Summary of Web Site Usage for NASA's
      Shoemaker Levy Home Page</li>

      <li>Title = A Description of Networked Information: The
      Dublin Core Element Set</li>

      <li>Title = Benjamin Franklin's Spectacles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If greater precision is desired, titles may be qualified by
    a scheme. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Title (scheme=AACR2) = The structure of language</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Author</h3>

    <p>The common understanding of <strong>author</strong> is the
    person(s) or agent primarily responsible for the intellectual
    content of the work. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Author = Smith, Jeffrey K.</li>

      <li>Author = World Book Encyclopedia</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <strong>author</strong> element could also be modified
    by a scheme such as USMARC. In the example below, the author is
    a person with an honorific title who lived between 1859 and
    1930.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Author (scheme=USMARC) = 100 1 Doyle, Author Conan $c
      Sir, $d 1859-1930</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This example illustrates an important problem. As Guenther
    <a href="#Guenther">[Guenther]</a> argues, the Dublin Core does
    not achieve an unambiguous mapping to a complex scheme such as
    USMARC with the above syntax because the
    <strong>Author</strong> element can map to many fields in the
    USMARC standard. It is also necessary to specify the portion of
    the external scheme that is being referenced. This is a general
    problem with all of the Dublin Core elements, and more
    discussion is required to solve it in a way that is
    satisfactory to all affected user communities.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Publisher</h3>

    <p><strong>Publisher</strong> is defined as the the agent or
    agency responsible for making the object available. For
    example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Publisher = University of Virginia Center for Electronic
      Text</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.5 OtherAgent</h3>

    <p><strong>OtherAgent</strong>s are the persons or
    organizations other than authors or publishers who have made
    significant intellectual contributions to the work. Strictly
    speaking, authors, publishers, and others responsible for
    intellectual content could all be described by an appropriately
    qualified element such as <strong>OtherAgent</strong>. The more
    verbose description adopted here is intended to make clearer
    the common roles of Author and Publisher. The
    <strong>OtherAgent</strong> element is intended to describe
    less common roles, such as editor, illustrator, compiler,
    convenor, photographer, or any secondary but significant role
    of content responsibility.</p>

    <p><strong>OtherAgent</strong> can be further specified using a
    scheme. For example, the TEI <a href="#TEI">[TEI]</a> standard
    contains valuable detail regarding the roles involved in
    creating document-like objects.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>OtherAgent (scheme=TEI) =
      &lt;pubStmt&gt;&lt;role&gt;Creation of machine-readable
      version&lt;/role&gt; &lt;name&gt;The Ohio State
      University&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some workshop participants suggested that it would be useful
    to define a set of common roles for the
    <strong>OtherAgent</strong> element so they could be used
    without referring to an external scheme. If this list were
    defined, the OtherAgent element could take the following
    forms:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>OtherAgent (role=Editor) = Weibel, Stuart L.</li>

      <li>OtherAgent (role=Illustrator) = Dennis, Wesley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.6 Date</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Date</strong> of publication is intended to
    reflect the date at which the object became available in its
    current form.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Date = May 6, 1995</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The scheme may be used to identify the syntactic form of the
    date. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Date (scheme=ANSI X3.30-1985) = 950506</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One problem with the <strong>Date</strong> element is that
    it is potentially misleading. Since electronic objects can be
    easily copied, the date stamp of a particular object may have
    no significance. It may be necessary to define a way to refer
    to more meaningful dates, such as latest date of the current
    controlled version for executable software, or the date of the
    original for digitized texts. More discussion is required to
    resolve this issue.</p>

    <h3>5.7 ObjectType</h3>

    <p><strong>ObjectType</strong> is defined as the abstract
    category or genre of the object, such as novel, poem,
    dictionary, thesaurus, executable software, source code, data
    file, or any other category judged to be useful for the
    discovery and retrieval of the resource being described. For
    example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ObjectType = Internet Draft Informational RFC</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The scheme can be used to indicate that the words used to
    describe the <strong>ObjectType</strong> are taken from
    controlled vocabulary. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ObjectType (scheme=AACR2) = computer file</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.8 Form</h3>

    <p><strong>Form</strong> is defined as the data representation
    of the object and is intended to provide an information seeker
    with information about the hardware or software resources
    necessary to display or operate the object. Information
    included should provide a sufficient description to make
    possible a judgement of usefulness prior to accessing an
    object. Examples might include Postscript-II document, Windows
    3.1 executable file, HTML file, or WordPerfect 6.1 document. In
    the example below, the form is an Internet Media Type.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Form (scheme=IMT) = text/html</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The use of the <strong>scheme</strong> qualifier for the
    <strong>Form</strong> element is analogous to that defined for
    the <strong>ObjectType</strong> element.</p>

    <h3>5.9 Identifier</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Identifier</strong> is the string or number used
    to uniquely identify an object. To enhance the usefulness of
    this data, a scheme value will specify the authority of the
    identifier. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identifier (scheme=ISBN) = 0-8230-2355-9</li>

      <li>Identifier (scheme=URL) =
      http://www.oclc.org/metadata.html</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Non-public identifiers, such as a university department's
    technical paper number, could also be used.</p>

    <h3>5.10 Relation</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Relation</strong> element identifies the
    object's relationship to other objects, print or electronic,
    such as other parts of a document hierarchy, other parts of a
    collection of documents, or another of a series of
    documents.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Relation</strong> element is designed to give
    the author flexibility when selecting the scope of the resource
    being described. In a hypertext environment, the resource might
    reasonably be a paragraph from a larger text, an entry on a Web
    page, or a slide in a collection. Of course, the resource may
    also be isolated or freestanding, in which case the
    <strong>Relation</strong> element is not relevant to the
    description. The simple record of the Maya Angelou poem in
    Section 2 omits the <strong>Relation</strong> element for this
    reason.</p>

    <p>The exact form of the <strong>Relation</strong> element
    needs to be worked out by further discussion, but it needs to
    contain at least two sub-elements: a description of the
    relation and a pointer to the related item. In the example
    below, it is assumed that the sub-elements
    <strong>Type</strong> and <strong>Identifier</strong> have been
    defined. The example below contains a URL, establishing the
    fact that the object being described is part of the proceedings
    from the Third International World-Wide Web Conference.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Relation (type=ContainedIn) (identifier = URL) =
      http://www.elsevier.nl/</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.11 Source</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Source</strong> element identifies the object
    from which the object being described is derived. This element
    is intended to connect an electronic object with a previous
    version, possibly in another medium, that establishes the
    history of the object. The <strong>Source</strong> element
    identifies other objects with the same intellectual content as
    the resource being described, while the
    <strong>Relation</strong> element identifies objects of
    different intellectual content with which the resource is
    logically connected.</p>

    <p>The data in the <strong>Source</strong> element is most
    easily understood as an identifier, named in the scheme, that
    uniquely points to the record describing the previous version.
    For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Source (scheme=ISBN) = 0-201-63337-X</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If it is more convenient, the <strong>Source</strong>
    element may contain an extensive bibliographic citation or even
    a recursive instance of the Dublin Core, as one of the examples
    in Appendix I illustrates. In such a case, the scheme is
    "Dublin Core."</p>

    <h3>5.12 Language</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Language</strong> element should specify the
    language of the intellectual content of the object being
    described. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Language = English</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If an abbreviation is used, the scheme can be used to
    identify the source. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Language (scheme=USMARC) = Eng</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.13 Coverage</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Coverage</strong> element describes the spatial
    and temporal characteristics of the object and is the key
    element for supporting spatial or temporal range searching on
    document-like objects that describe geospatial data The first
    example below is a simple, nontechnical use of the
    <strong>Coverage</strong> element. The second example
    illustrates spatial coverage, with the scheme identifying the
    data as latitude/longitude coordinates; and the third example
    shows temporal coverage, with the scheme identifying the syntax
    of the dates.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Coverage (type = spatial) = The Atlantic Ocean</li>

      <li>Coverage (type = spatial, scheme = LATLONG) = {West =
      180, East = 180, North = 90, South = 90}</li>

      <li>Coverage (type = temporal, scheme = ANSI X3.30-1985) =
      {Begin = 19910101, End = 19930601}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For greater precision, some workshop participants suggested
    that <strong>Coverage</strong> should be modified by the
    qualifiers <strong>spatial</strong> and
    <strong>temporal</strong>. See the sample SGML Document Type
    Definition in Appendix II.</p>

    <h2>6.0 Extensions to the Dublin Core</h2>

    <p>Extensibility is an essential feature of any metadata system
    because a single set of metadata elements, no matter how large,
    cannot possibly accommodate all resource types. But increasing
    the size of the core element set would complicate rather than
    simplify the problem because a large element set would be less
    comprehensible to a diverse user population. To reconcile these
    conflicting demands, the Dublin Core has been designed from the
    outset to be small but extensible.</p>

    <p>This is manifested in three ways. First, local additions are
    accommodated by allowing elements to be added to the record
    that describes a resource. These additional fields are not
    guaranteed to be understood outside the community that proposed
    them, but they need not cause errors for systems that
    understand the core element set. The extensions may be an
    unstructured string of text, a pointer to another record that
    conforms to an established standard, or even the record
    itself.</p>

    <p>The second mechanism for implementing extensibility is the
    "scheme" sub-element, described in the previous section. The
    set of values for "scheme" is open-ended and unspecified in the
    Dublin Core because these are expected to be supplied by user
    communities. For some elements, such as
    <strong>Subject</strong>, the set of values will be small
    because only a limited number of classification hierarchies are
    available from which subject terms can be derived. For other
    elements, the set of scheme values may be large, reflecting the
    complexity of the resources being described. For example, the
    <strong>Identifier</strong> element may have schemes of
    <strong>FTP</strong>, <strong>URL</strong>,
    <strong>URN</strong>, <strong>ISBN</strong>, or any number of
    locally assigned schemes. These scheme values must necessarily
    reflect our current understanding of the difficult problem of
    name resolution for electronic objects accessible from the
    Internet.</p>

    <p>The third mechanism for extensibility is the labeling of the
    Dublin Core itself. This can be understood as a version number
    and it may be changed if new elements are added to the base set
    or if the semantics of existing elements changes. The current
    version of the Dublin Core is 0.1.</p>

    <p>This discussion describes the principles by which records
    created with the Dublin Core can be extended, but a separate
    paper is required for a more rigorous discussion that proposes
    implementation solutions.</p>

    <h2>7.0 Unresolved Issues</h2>

    <p>This document describes the work of a relatively small
    number of people who have begun to address the difficult issues
    arising from the need to provide descriptions of resources in
    order to promote their discovery in a networked environment
    such as the Internet. Of course, this is a large problem, and
    the work has only begun. One of the goals of this document is
    to record what has been proposed so far--in the Dublin Metadata
    Workshop, and in followup discussions with the participants. If
    this effort has succeeded, others need not spend time covering
    the same ground, and it will be possible to move quickly to the
    issues that remain. Of course, more discussion and refinement
    of the core element set is expected. But there are larger
    problems to be solved, especially those involving versions,
    extensibility and character sets.</p>

    <h3>7.1 Versions</h3>

    <p>The treatment of different versions of an electronic
    resource has not been addressed in this document because there
    is no consensus regarding the definition or even the vocabulary
    used to describe versions of electronic objects. They seem to
    be fundamentally different from the versions of printed
    materials, such as editions and printings, which have been
    well-described by scholars in the library community. Unlike
    printed versions, new electronic versions often supplant or
    obliterate older versions. Electronic versions also proliferate
    more easily, and as a result, differences between versions may
    be more slight.</p>

    <p>It is therefore nontrivial to ask: when are two different
    versions of an electronic resource the same work? The easy
    answer is that they are the same if bitwise comparisons reveal
    them to be identical. But this criterion is too restrictive
    because two electronic objects, such as a document that exists
    in WordPerfect and ASCII formats, could have identical
    intellectual content but fail the test of bitwise identity.</p>

    <p>Without a better understanding of electronic versions, it
    may not be possible to use the Dublin Core to create
    unambiguous records that describe different versions of a
    resource. If the creators of records judged two versions to be
    the same work, they would use the <strong>Source</strong>
    element to describe the earlier version; otherwise, they would
    record this data in the <strong>Relation</strong> field. This
    shows that the important and reasonably well-understood concept
    of <em>Edition</em> can be captured in either of two elements
    of the Dublin Core.</p>

    <h3>7.2 Extensibility</h3>

    <p>Although the principles for extending the Dublin Core are
    straightforward, much work remains to be done before an
    important question is answered: how can records be extended in
    such a way that meets the needs of different communities while
    maintaining some level of interoperability? The extended
    records could conform to the specifications of the Dublin Core,
    yet still contain an infinite variety of data types and
    standards. There are several ways to solve this problem but
    none of them are currently feasible.</p>

    <p>First, the problem could be eliminated by requiring a single
    consistent transfer syntax such as SGML. But this would violate
    one of the underlying assumptions of the Dublin Core and would
    be impossible to enforce. Second, a requirement could be added
    to the Dublin Core stipulating that an extended record must
    contain a pointer to the software that understands it. This
    violates the rule that all elements in the Dublin Core are
    optional and assumes the existence of software that understands
    the heterogeneous records yet to be created. Third, user
    communities could devise and maintain their own standards.
    However, there is no guarantee that the independent evolution
    of standards for the specification of metadata to promote
    resource discovery in an electronic environment will produce
    even minimal interoperability.</p>

    <h3>7.3 Character Sets</h3>

    <p>ASCII is the most widely deployed representation of text,
    and in the interest of interoperability, information exchange
    on the Internet relies on it almost exclusively. However, the
    Internet reaches communities all over the world. If it is to
    become a significant cultural force, the needs of languages
    using non-ASCII character sets will eventually have to be
    addressed. These issues have been avoided in this document
    because the intent is to adopt the solutions put forth by other
    standards makers.</p>

    <p>The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) introduces
    Internet Media Types, including text representations other than
    ASCII. HTML, used by most World-Wide Web browsers, is a
    proposed Internet Media Type as well as an SGML application. In
    the MIME and SGML specifications, however, character
    representation is notoriously complex, and the two
    specifications are inconsistent and incompatible. The Internet
    Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the MIME_SGML, HTML and
    HyperTextTransfer Protocol (HTTP) working groups are attempting
    to rectify these inconsistencies and are discussing the best
    ways of incorporating text representations other than
    ASCII.</p>

    <h3>7.4 "Third-party" Metadata</h3>

    <p>In the largest sense, "metadata" includes any information
    which purports to be about other information. Some of the most
    useful metadata is produced by persons other than librarians
    and document owners, and it can be found neither in card
    catalogs nor in self-descriptions of the documents themselves.
    Many kinds of such "third-party" metadata (e.g.,
    bibliographies) are indispensable aids to information
    discovery. It should be possible to allow topic-oriented
    metadata documents with semantic network functionality to be
    cooperatively authored, interchanged, and integrated into
    master documents. Such documents (and amalgamated master
    documents) might resemble traditional catalogs, indexes,
    thesauri, encyclopediae, bibliographies, etc., with functional
    enhancements such as the hiding of references that are outside
    the scope of the researcher's interest, etc. Early work in this
    area is being done by the <a href="#CApH">[CApH]</a> group.</p>

    <h2>8.0 Implementations</h2>

    <p>The OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop is one of a series of
    developments that will lead to more effective resource
    discovery systems for the Internet. Other developments include
    the Denver 1992 data element discussions, the Library of
    Congress 1994 Workshop on the description of electronic
    resources, the IETF Uniform Resource Locator working group
    meetings, the Digital Library projects funded by the National
    Science Foundation, and many other activities in stakeholder
    communitites, as well as the experimental Web crawler
    "infobots."</p>

    <p>It is no small challenge to integrate these disparate
    activities, each with vocabularies, agendas, and objectives of
    their own, into a coherent whole. One of the goals of the
    OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop was to bring many of the relevant
    stakeholders together for such discussions, and some progress
    has been achieved toward this end.</p>

    <p>All of these activities are but the first hesitant steps
    toward the goal of rational resource description. Whatever
    advances in understanding and communication among the
    participants were achieved at the Dublin Workshop, the most
    important measures of success will be the dissemination of
    these ideas in the community. But the ultimate proof is in the
    implementations of these ideas.</p>

    <p>A number of Metadata Workshop conferees represent
    organizations that have ongoing activities or are starting
    activities that will be influenced by the results of the
    workshop. These include:</p>

    <h4>8.1.1 The OCLC Spectrum Project</h4>

    <p>The primary goal of the Spectrum project is to develop a
    tool that enables individuals, with or without specialized
    knowledge of library cataloging or markup to create records for
    describing and accessing networked electronic resources of
    various types.</p>

    <h4>8.1.2 The OCLC Internet Resources Cataloging Project</h4>

    <p>A group of volunteer libraries is participating in a U.S.
    Department of Education-funded project to identify, select, and
    catalog Internet-accessible electronic resources using
    standards and conventions widely adopted in the library
    community.</p>

    <p>The overall objectives of this project are to employ,
    evaluate and extend the library catalog model to embrace
    Internet resources, and to focus the intellectual resources of
    scores of professions on the attendant problems and
    opportunities. Records created in this project will conform to
    USMARC standards and will be suitable for integration within
    local and national library catalogs.</p>

    <p>Implementors are using the Dublin Core as the set of
    metadata elements to include in a resource discovery system
    based on whois++ and the centroids mesh. It will act primarily
    as a method for transforming different data formats. In
    particular it will translate from the more complex TEI header
    into a simpler attribute/value flat list based on the Dublin
    Core. This flat list will be the basis for limited information
    discovery.</p>

    <h2>9.0 Next Steps</h2>

    <p>Refinement and standardization of the metadata element set
    defined in this document will be an ongoing, dynamic process
    involving many stakeholder communities. No single forum will
    suffice to air all concerns and no single standard can be
    expected to accommodate the needs of all communities. The
    problem must be divided into manageable chunks and the process
    must engage the relevant stakeholder communities. Implicit in
    the present activity is the proposition that there are core
    elements common to many object types, and that a simple,
    extensible framework of such elements can be defined to support
    more complete resource descriptions.</p>

    <p>The initial objective--the specification of elements for the
    discovery of document-like objects--can be extended in a
    variety of directions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Expansion of the Dublin Core to include other object
      types, such as services or collections.</li>

      <li>Expansion of the Dublin Core to embrace functionality
      other than resource discovery, such as archival control and
      the authentication of users and charging mechanisms.</li>

      <li>Establishing standardized methods for extensibility.</li>

      <li>Refinement of existing work. The Dublin Core is an
      untested approach to the description of resources that will
      need to be modified with experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>OCLC and NCSA will establish a workshop series to address
    aspects of this agenda. A Metadata Workshop Steering Committee
    will be established to define topics and assure appropriate
    representation of stakeholders. Design groups of perhaps a
    dozen or fewer individuals will be solicited to prepare
    discussion papers to focus workshop activities. Participants
    will be invited based on their publicly evident accomplishments
    in relevant areas or by reviewed application. Workshops will be
    limited to 50 or fewer participants and conducted in roughly
    the style of the March 1995 Workshop.</p>

    <p>Further work will be done at a Birds of a Feather (BOF)
    meeting planned for the Stockholm IETF Meeting in July of 1995.
    A BOF discussion is an initial step in the establishment of an
    IETF working group. The IETF serves best in the capacity of
    validating design work that is done by smaller, more focused
    groups. An IETF working group on Metadata will provide an
    effective way of involving the technical stakeholders in the
    computer and networking community that must implement and use
    the standards.</p>

    <p>Finally, active promotion of results will be carried out by
    establishing liaison with formal associations of stakeholders.
    In the library community, MARC standards evolve under the
    guidance of the Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information
    Committee (MARBI), composed of representatives of the Library
    of Congress and other stakeholders in the library community. A
    close relationship should be sustained between this committee
    and the Metadata Work Group. Relationships should also be
    established with publishers, document vendors, SGML vendors and
    theoreticians working on the problem of text encoding. Other
    communities also have requirements that must be accommodated in
    any framework for resource description. These communities
    include the GIS community, Government information providers and
    business communication groups.</p>

    <h2>Appendix 1.0: Sample Records Encoded Using the Dublin
    Metadata Core</h2>

    <p>This Appendix contains two sample Dublin Core records
    encoded in a simple syntax that might be translated easily to
    SGML. As in all other examples in this document, the syntax of
    these records is presented only for clarity of exposition.</p>

    <p>The first example was created by a subject-matter specialist
    who has no library cataloging expertise. It describes an
    Internet Request for Comment (RFC) found on a Web page
    containing similar RFCs. The Relation element points to the Web
    page and to a similar record on the same page.</p>

    <p>The second Dublin Core record was created by a librarian for
    a Postscript version of a monograph that is derived from a
    previous printed edition. It contains references to schemes
    commonly used in the library community. The link to the printed
    version is described in the <strong>Source</strong> element,
    here realized as a recursive instance of the Dublin Core
    record.</p>

    <h2>Appendix 2.0: A Proposed Document Type Definition for the
    Dublin Metadata Core</h2>

    <p>This sample DTD is included here to make the proposals in
    this paper more precise and to promote discussion among those
    wishing to make improvements. The attribute
    <strong>Scheme</strong> is used when reference is made to an
    external authority for notation or vocabulary.</p>

    <p>As in all examples in this paper, the DTD in this appendix
    specifies one possible syntax for an SGML version of the Dublin
    core. It is for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<pre>
&lt;!-- This is the ISO8879:1986 document type definition for the DublinCore URC.	--&gt;
&lt;!--  Note: This DTD is subject to discussion and/or modification by the 
	    participants of the OCLC/NSCA Metadata Workshop.
