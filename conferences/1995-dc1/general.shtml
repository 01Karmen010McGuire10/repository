<p><b>The OCLC Online Computer Library Center Office of Research and The National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications announces an intensive workshop focused 
on the description of network resources:</b></p>

    <h3><b>The Essential Elements of Network Object
    Description</b></h3>

    <h3><b>General Information</b></h3>
    <hr />

    <p>This invitational workshop convenes selected professionals
    from diverse but related fields of computer science,
    librarianship, online information services, abstracting and
    indexing, imaging and geospatial data, museum and archive
    control, and others, to address and advance the state of the
    art in the development and extension of methods, standards, and
    protocols to facilitate the description, organization,
    discovery, and access of network information resources.</p>

    <p><i>This conference is available by invitation only.</i></p>
    <hr />

    <p><b>Goals</b></p>

    <ul>
      <li>To achieve consensus on a core set of data elements for
      document analogs and explore elements for other network
      specific object types.</li>

      <li>To promote a common understanding of the needs,
      approaches, strengths, shortfalls, and proposed solutions of
      the cognizant professions, stakeholders, communities, and
      constituencies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Proposed topics include (1) a taxonomy of network resources,
    their attributes, essential data elements and descriptors, (2)
    the mapping of defined data elements to various implementation
    formats, and (3) specific tasks necessary to advance both
    standards development and the implementation, testing, and
    evaluation of systems.</p>
    <hr />
    <b>Background</b> 

    <p>Describing and organizing information to facilitate its
    subsequent discovery and access, one of the oldest human
    activities, continues to evolve to meet the needs of
    information users and exploit technological innovations that
    improve functionality, save time, reduce cost, and broaden
    access to electronic information resources.</p>

    <p>The advent of and widespread access to wide-area computer
    internetworking, coupled with the explosion of electronic
    information resources, mark another signal moment in the
    history of information management, one that now more than ever
    requires the interaction of diverse professional communities
    and areas of human knowledge.</p>

    <p>A meeting of change agents in the information management
    professions is expected to promote the exchange of perspectives
    and expertise necessary to advance the state of the art.</p>
