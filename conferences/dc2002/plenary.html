    size="-1"><b>Abstract:</b> The presentation will provide
    insights in the work being conducted by the Digital Library
    Research and Prototyping Team of the Research Library of the
    Los Alamos National Laboratory. The discussion of that work
    will serve as a seed to reflect on broader issues in Digital
    Library activities. Topics that will be addressed include novel
    applications of the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata
    Harvesting and some thoughts about its future in scholarly
    communication; the NISO standardization of OpenURL; work on
    repository architecture; a data-mining collaboration with Old
    Dominion University aimed at exposing document relationships;
    and work looking at bringing library services closer to
    users.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Herbert
    Van de Sompel graduated in mathematics and computer science at
    Ghent University, and in 2000, obtained a Ph.D. there for his
    research on dynamic and context-sensitive reference linking,
    now commonly known as the OpenURL framework. From 1982 to 1998
    he worked as Head of Library Automation at Ghent University. In
    1999, Herbert spent six months at the Research Library of the
    Los Alamos National Laboratory working on reference linking
    problems and preprint related matters. While at Los Alamos,
    Herbert started the Open Archives Initiative with Paul Ginsparg
    and Rick Luce. During the academic year 2000/2001, Herbert was
    Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Cornell University,
    working in the Digital Library Research Group, and teaching
    Computing Methods for Digital Libraries. Afterwards, he was
    Director of e-Strategy and Programmes at the British Library.
    Now he is back at the Research Library of the Los Alamos
    National Laboratory, doing Digital Library Research and
    Protoyping. With Carl Lagoze, Herbert forms the Executive of
    the Open Archives Initiative, responsible for the publication
    of the Santa Fe Convention (2000) and the Open Archives
    Protocol for Metadata Harvesting Protocol (2001 &amp; 2002).
    The OpenURL is the subject of a NISO standardization process,
    and Herbert serves on the NISO AX Committee charged with taking
    on that effort.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
    size="-1"><b>Abstract</b>: The Semantic Web is an evolution of
    the World Wide Web designed to support machine readable data as
    well as human readable material. The semantic web defines set
    of standardized representations for data (XML/RDF) and for the
    conceptual structures behind that data (RDF Schema, Web
    Ontology) to support a variety of new metadata applications.
    Technologies based on standards may be used to improve
    searching, navigation and management of content, data
    integration from disparate systems, discovery and composition
    of web services and facilitate software agents. This
    presentation will provide an overview of W3C's Semantic Web
    Activity as well as a discussion of the supporting
    technologies. A practical demonstration of these technologies
    for organizing and navigating distributed information on the
    web will also be provided.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eric
    Miller is the Activity Lead for the W3C World Wide Web
    Consortium's Semantic Web Initiative.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Eric's
    responsibilities include the architectural and technical
    leadership in the design and evolution of Semantic Web
    infrastructure. Additional responsibilities include building
    support among user and vendor communities for the Semantic Web
    by illustrating the benefits to those communities and means of
    participating in the creation of a metadata-ready Web. And
    finally to establish liaisons with other technical standards
    bodies involved in Web-related technology to ensure compliance
    with existing Semantic Web standards and collect requirements
    for future W3C work.</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Before
    joining the W3C, Eric was a Senior Research Scientist at OCLC
    Online Computer Library Center, Inc. and the Associate Director
