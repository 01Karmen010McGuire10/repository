<li>Chair of DCMI Architecture Working Group: Vacant
<li>Agenda prepared by: Harry Wagner


<li>The objective of the architecture working group is to discuss and develop a model, strategy and roadmap for the practical deployment of Dublin Core metadata using mainstream Web technologies.
<br>
The breakout session scheduled for Monday,  October 14, will focus on finalizing on issues related to the DC schemas with the intent of finalizing both those schemas.  Discussions will include issues with all schema types, including DTD,
XSD and RDFS .
<br>
Below is a brief summary the principle schema issues, and which will serve as a basis for our discussion.  
<ul>

<li>XSD Issues:
<ul>
<li>	Ann Wrightson has proposed that "DC XML schemas should have as a design criterion that there is a DTD equivalent which is fully equivalent except for simple datatyping".  See: 
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-schemas&T=0&F=&S=&X=65D33B73C7073E8F3F&Y=wagnerh@oclc.org&P=539">

http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-schemas&T=0&F=&S=&X=65D33B73C7073E8F3F&Y=wagnerh@oclc.org&P=539</a>

<li>	Naomi Dushay raised an issue with the SimpleLiteral type and it's support (or lack of) by various XML parsers.  See:

<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-architecture&T=0&O=D&P=11222">
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-architecture&T=0&O=D&P=11222</a>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>RDFS Issues:
<ul>
<li>	The RDF-schema modeling issue discussed offline between Eric and Roland. 
A brief outline of the issue (secondhand from Tom Baker) is at:
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-schemas&T=0&F=&S=&X=65D33B73C7073E8F3F&Y=wagnerh@oclc.org&P=147">

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pete Johnston raised two issues:
<ul>
<li>	whether or not  there is any benefit to introducing Classes to provide "DCMI-specific-typing" and whether or not there are advantages to dividing metadata about DCMI terms across multiple schemas. See
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0210&L=dc-schemas&T=0&F=&S=&X=3393352DC6462A889F&Y=wagnerh@oclc.org&P=55">

<li>	An issue was raised regarding the need to introduce a new namespace for encoding schemes. See:
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0209&L=dc-schemas&T=0&F=&S=&X=5D84F33F81FE561D90&Y=wagnerh@oclc.org&P=57">

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>General Issues:
<ul>
<li>	We need a solution for how to maintain the schemas (short-term).  The primary concern here is adding new terms as defined by the UB.  The long-term solution is that the VMT will produce the schemas.  In the interim they will need to be managed manually.

<li>	Should we consider changing what the namespaces resolve to?  Does it make sense from an XML point of view to reference a namespace that resolves to a RDF schema?

<li>Chair: Thom Pick

<li>1.      Introductory Note
<br>

DC-Environment Interest Group has been initiated at the Tokyo DC 2001 BOF
meeting. The initial group identified several items of interest:
<ul>
<li>       to collect information on usage of DC in the environmental domain,
<li>     to give guidance of the use of DC in the environmental domain,
<li>      to install a forum for discussion of issues concerning DC with respect to
environmental information resources,
<li>      to develop an application profile for the environmental domain, based on
DC
<li>       to establish the representation of the environmental domain and their
issues in DCMI (and vice versa?)
</ul>

<p>It took a while to get the groups internet representation started. But since
February 2002 we have an IG homepage
<a href="http://www.dublincore.org/groups/environ/">http://www.dublincore.org/groups/environ/.</a> Along came a discussions forum
that may be accessed at
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=dc-environment&A=1">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=dc-environment&A=1.</a>

<p>In the meantime we have finished a report on the use of DC in the
environmental domain and have been working on a first draft for a DC-ENV
application profile. We should use some time of the meeting to discuss these
two products. A further issue is to discuss how to proceed on compiling
guidance material. Finally we would like to discuss liaison with other
related initiatives like ISO 19000 and the Open GIS Consortium.

<li>2.      Survey on the use of DC in the environmental domain
<br>
The report is available at
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=dc-environment&A=1">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=dc-environment&A=1</a>

<li>3.      DC-Environment Application Profile
<br>
A first draft of the dc-env application profile has been compiled by stefan
strathmann of  the University and State Library of Lower Saxony. The issues
to discuss are:
what additional terms (elements, qualifiers, schemes) are needed to
facilitate of environmental information resources on the internet. A new
element Measurement Data has been proposed. Also Gelos has been proposed as
a scheme for dc:subject
The first draft is available at
<a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/DC-ENVIRONMENT/DC-Env_AP_First_Draft.doc">http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/files/DC-ENVIRONMENT/DC-Env_AP_First_Draft.doc</a>

<li>4.      Guidance Material for the use of DC in the environmental domain
<br>
Discuss further procedure for compilation of Guidance Material

<li>5.      Relations to other Metadata initiatives in the environmental domain
<br>
The ISO 19115 standard defines general-purpose metadata, in the field of
geographic information.  More detailed metadata for geographic datatypes and
geographic services are defined in other ISO 19100 series standards and user
extensions [ISO 19115].  This implementation specification is also intended
to define implementation guidelines for general-purpose metadata.  An
attempt was made to incorporate interpretations of some other 19100 series
standards into the implementation examples.
<br>
Several mappings exist to other environmental metadata standards like e.g.
GELOS and the german-austrian UDK.
<br>
Simon Cox of the Open GIS Consortium has compiled a paper describing a
framework and encoding for measurements and observations
(<a href="http://www.opengis.org/techno/discussions/02-027.pdf">http://www.opengis.org/techno/discussions/02-027.pdf</a>). This is required
specifically for the Sensor Collection Service and related components of an
OGC Sensor Web capability, and also for general support for OGC compliant
systems dealing in technical measurements in science and engineering.
The aim is to define a number of terms used for measurements, and the
relationships between them. This proposal discusses Observation,
Measurement, Observed Value, Coverage, SensorInstance, ObservableType, and
related terms, presented using UML class diagrams and in equivalent GML
conformant XML serialisations.
<br>
We should discuss the position of DC to these initiatives.

<li>Introduction
<br>
The overall goal of the DCMI Registry Working Group (WG) is the development
of a metadata registry providing authoritative information regarding the
DCMI vocabulary and the relationship between terms in that vocabulary.
<br>
The Registry WG provides a forum for discussion of registry-related activity
and interaction with other registry and information management initiatives
that share issues of common interest and relevance. Additionally, the WG
provides a forum for liaising with the DCMI Usage Board and the related
vocabulary management development activity.
<br>
The specific goals of this WG are:
<ul>
<li>1.      The development of an operational registry providing a Web-based user
interface (phase 1) and various application programming interfaces (phase 2)
that facilitate the discovery, navigation and understanding of the DCMI, and
related, semantics.
<li>2.      Promote the acceptance and use of the DCMI vocabulary.
<li>3.      Provide an authoritative source of information regarding the DCMI
vocabulary.
</ul>
The scheduled implementation date for phase 1 is 9/30/2002.  The project is
on schedule and is expected to be completed prior to the WG breakout
session.
