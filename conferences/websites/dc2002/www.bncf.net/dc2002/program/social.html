            of service (QoS) technology has been implemented to be applied to 
            new applications on the next-generation Internet. However, as new 
            applications such as P2P and stream application have many kinds of 
            features and requirements, some additional features should be added 
            to current QoS control technology. For example, they require a definition 
            of a single policy to operate QoS control in the management domain 
            consistently and efficiently. Policy definition for transport layer 
            in a domain and among domains is being discussed at IETF to set a 
            standard process, however detailed policy corresponding to the application 
            or contents information according to the application semantics has 
            not been discussed. Therefore we developed QoS policy control mechanism 
            using metadata which is defined as a structured data according to 
            the application semantics. Though metadata and transport mechanism 
            can be located into quite different positions in the concept of network 
            layers, we made them successfully collaborated by defining meta policy. 
            In this presentation, we describe our system architecture to define 
            a meta policy based on the requirements and information contents from 
            the application as a high level layer concept to be able to classify 
            the network behavior. Our approach enables to multiple QoS control 
            and collaboration among domains. </font></li>

            The project addresses the needs of end-users (teachers and students) 
            and content providers interacting with the School of Design of the 
            Politecnico di Milano, moving from the assumption that conventional 
            modalities of archiving and presentation currently adopted by the 
            Politecnico and other academic institutions are not coherent with 
            design teaching, because the typical outputs of industrial design 
            process are 3D models or 2D graphics, not just texts or simple images. 
            The challenges, philosophy and methodology in creating this evolving 
            Web-based, cataloguing, multimedia knowledge-base of VR design resources 
            are discussed, along with description of the related system and prototype.

            push forward the diffusion of multimedia communication services. Anyway 
            the real effective development of such services will strongly depend 
            on the availability of a reliable platform for managing all the issues 
            related to the exchange of multimedia items among users through heterogeneous 
            networks and systems. Such a need is also witnessed by the disparate 
            initiative whose goal is to achieve Digital Items Identification and 
            Description. Some calls have been already issued regarding the identification 
            and description schemes: although it seems that metadata (and XML) 
            will have an important role for addressing this issue, anyway it is 
            evident that much work has still to be done. In this presentation,

            to embed in a digital content metadata related to Intellectual Property

            in real primary and secondary classrooms and schools and in educational

            are also used within an RDF structure, including a novel vocabulary 
            developed in order to describe classroom activities and their relationship 
            to broader educational strategies and vCalendar's recurrence rule

            developing an e-learning metadata standard to be used across all federal

            Canada, as elsewhere around the world, government is trying to move 
            into the Internet Age, to communicate more and more interactively 
            with an ever-increasing portion of the electorate and to increase 
            the interoperability of digitized media. The Canadian Government Online 
            Initiative, of which we are a part, is an example of this trend. To 
            facilitate access to our materials, we need metatags, metatags that, 
            by and large were originally set up to deal with print media. Thus, 
            we have been struggling in recent years to apply metadata to a test 
            database of Canadian cultural audio and visual clips that we call 
            "Heritage Line." We have followed many avenues for making our data 
            searchable and accessible. We have used the Dublin Core schema, both 
            with the qualified set of elements as well as the unqualified set. 
            Our problems arose specifically with respect to the elements 'type' 
            and 'format.' Mpeg-7 currently appears to offer a solution to our 
            problem. </font></li>

            for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) 
            Metdata Project. In order to facilitate as much interoperability as 
            possible, the project selected the Dublin Core as the basis on which 
            to build an optimal element set for the NIEHS metadata project. This 
            presentation discusses implementation issues, giving specific attention 
            to: when to declare element usage in an application profile rather 
            than defining a new element in a namespace; whether an application 
            profile can apply qualifiers from one namespace to elements from another; 
            and which version of an element that is defined in a variety of different 
            contexts should be used. It is determined that many of these questions 
            remain unanswered, and the ultimate decisions will, in part, depend 
            on standards yet to be established concerning XML and/or RDF serialization 
            of application profiles. The resulting discussion provides suggestions

            presentation proposes integrated framework architecture of content 
            delivery based on metadata associated network services and capabilities. 
            The basic concept of this architecture is a policy based content delivery 
            control using content metadata and user metadata. By making a network 
            being aware about content as well as user's requirement, more user-oriented 
            content delivery service can be achieved. The proposed architecture 
            includes "Metadata driven QoS control" and "Metadata driven One Source 
            Multi-Use". The former relates to Quality of Service (QoS) in terms 
            of content delivery service achieved by metadata-driven network resource 
            control, and the latter relates to content adaptations to meet usage 
            environment and user preference across a wide range of networks and 
            devices. By using proposed framework architecture, content delivery 
            service providers can establish particular policies to harmonize various 
            requirements described by metadata. </font></li>

            a graphical user interface that allows navigating and exploring these 
            results. An interactive matrix display is used for showing the hyperlinks 
            of a site search or other search queries in different hierarchical 
            category systems. The results of a site search are not only shown 
            as a list, but also classified in an ontology-based category system. 
            So the user has the possibility to explore and navigate within the 
            results of his query. The system offers a flexible way to refine the 
            query by drilling down in the hierarchical structured categories. 
            The user can explore the results in one category with the so called 
            List Browser or in two categories at the same time with the so called

            enable Dublin Core metadata to become a global standard for locating 
            information on the Web, it is essential that such metadata be provided 
            in different languages and in a variety of scripts. This would enable 
            search and retrieval of Web documents in all languages. The presentation 
            reports an attempt to translate Dublin Core metadata elements into 
            Marathi language (the local language of Maharashtra State in India), 
            render them in Devnagari script and apply them to a significant section 
            of Marathi literature - viz. the writings of one of the "saint-poets" 
            of the Middle Ages. A group of "saint-poets" in Maharashtra from the 
            13th century (e.g. Jnandev 1275-96) to the 17th century (e.g. Tukaram 
            1608-90) helped establish the 'Bhakti' (devotional) school of Hinduism 
            in Western India and assisted in its spread from southern to northern 
            India. Even today, the lives of the saint-poets and their literature 
            continue to inspire a large section of the Marathi speaking population 
            and provide them with emotional solace. As such, their writings constitute 
            an important segment of Marathi literature and researchers from all 
            over the world are engaged in studying it. The original writings (including 
            the early handwritten manuscripts) and commentaries on them are scattered 
            at different places in India and are now beginning to make an appearance 
            on the Web. Our efforts are to create a web based database and to 
            assign Dublin Core international metadata standards rendered in Marathi 
            for cataloguing the literature of one of the prominent "saint-poets" 
            - Chokha Mela - available in print and electronic format as well as 
            on Internet. This is conceived as part of a larger project of organizing 
            all the literature of the "saint-poets". The Marathi metadata elements 
            will enable search and retrieval in the original language and script. 
            Readers can download online full text documents if available. The 
            database will be available online via PuneNet at http://punenet.ernet.in 
            in the near future. It is also envisaged that the database will develop 
            cooperatively and online data entry and data correction facility will

            metadata is simply metadata that describes the accessibility of resources 
            and services, usually those on, or available through, the web. Awareness 
            of widespread web content inaccessibility led to work being done to 
            develop guidelines for authors and others to make sure that content 
            would be more accessible to those with special access needs, especially 
            those with disabilities who were being disenfranchised by their lack 
            of access to the web. Currently, work is being done to find ways of 
            signalling the degree of accessibility of resources, and ways of matching 
            resources to searches and people. In addition, accessibility metadata 
            could be used to repair some inaccessibility problems on the fly. 
            This presentation describes some of the work being done and the problems 
            that have contributed to make the progress comparatively slow. </font></li>

            article presents the general situation of metadata in France and the 
            projects (in progress or realised) of the use of documentary languages 
            as subject metadata. The article gives the reasons for the choice 
            of human indexing instead of search engines and also describes one 
            example of indexing language enhancement in order to make it more 
            user friendly. The presentation focuses on a possible interaction 
            between the use of indexing languages as subject metadata and the 
            semi-automatic maintenance of indexing languages themselves. This 
            approach is not really wide-spread yet. The fact is, however, that 
            the manual maintenance is costly in terms of human resources. It could 
            be considerably simplified thanks to corpuses of documents indexed 
            with subject metadata. </font></li>

            this presentation, a new method to solve the validation problem that 
            arises when exchanging information between heterogeneous systems with 
            different vocabularies is proposed. The problem of validation is addressed 
            by introducing the concepts of MicroSchema, used in a namespace environment. 
            To demonstrate and test the concept a new flexible XML-model for exchange 
            of research documentation in Current Research Information Systems 
            (CRIS) has been developed and proposed. A working XML-exchange model 
            for metadata exchange between different CRIS and between with library 
            systems and CRIS are described. The working model is limited to documentation 
            produced by the researchers. The ideas, XML-model and construction 
            proposed and used in the working model are extensible, and can be 
            expanded to the whole field of research documentation in addition 
            to other fields. </font></li>

          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Abstract: Type 
            has come to the fore as one of the primary organizing elements in 
            the design of input forms suitable for the generation of high quality 
            moving image metadata. A lack of semantic precision in both the definition 
            and in the conceptual complexity of DC.Type's encoding scheme has 
            prompted a re-evaluation of its usefulness as an element to be populated 
            for interchange and discovery. In order to introduce precision to 
            this element, a distinction is made between subject-based descriptors 
            (genres), object based descriptors (forms), and manifestations or 
            format-based descriptors (formats). A DCT2 vocabulary is proposed 
            for DC.Type as a point of discussion for facilitating the deployment 
            of domain specific encoding schemes and for filling gaps in the current 
            list of terms. </font></li>

            is a web resource supporting the visual arts and music curriculum 
            in New Zealand schools. It contains 2500 multimedia items from the 
            collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library, which holds the national 
            cultural heritage collections, and 300 resources from other sources. 
            The product uses a metadata scheme that combines simple (unqualified) 
            DC and qualified DC, EAD and local extensions expressed in XML and 
            uses the RDF framework proposed by DCMI for expressing qualified DC 
            in RDF/XML. This metadata schema will continue to evolve to support 
            interchange of the NLNZ's digital resources within the library, archival 
            and education communities. </font></li>
