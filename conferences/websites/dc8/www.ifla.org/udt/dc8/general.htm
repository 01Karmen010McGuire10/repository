<h3><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">General Information</font></h3>



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Workshop Location</font></h4>



The workshop will be held at the <a href="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca">National Library of Canada</a>.  The National Library of Canada is located at 395 Wellington Street in Ottawa. The Library, which shares its building with the National Archives of Canada, is near the Parliament Buildings, the Supreme Court, Bank of Canada, and other major federal institutions. 

<p>

The National Library is fully accessible to wheelchair users. An access ramp is located at the front of the building, and there are washrooms and automatic door openers throughout the building accessible to wheelchair users.



<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Transportation</font></h4>



The <a href="http://www.ottawa-airport.com/airport.htm">Ottawa International Airport</a> is the main airport serving the Ottawa area. There are also two airports located in Montreal, Quebec; <a href="http://www.admtl.com/index-e.html">Dorval or Mirabel International Airport</a>. Montreal is approximately 190 km's (118 miles) to downtown Ottawa.
Contact your travel agent or the Airport directly for car rental and bus transportation.

<p>

All airline tickets departing from the Ottawa International Airport are subject to a $10 Canadian, Airport Improvement Fee. 

<p>

The Ottawa airport limousines run 24 hours a day. The price depends on your destination, but from the airport to the Conference Hotel it should cost approximately $20.00-$25.00 Canadian. 







<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Insurance</font></h4>



It is highly recommended that all participants carry the proper travel and health insurance.  The National Library of Canada cannot accept liability for any accidents or injuries that may occur during the workshop.





<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Passport and Visas</font></h4>



A valid passport is required for entry into Canada.  Visas are required for participants from certain countries. Determining specific requirements or restrictions for entry into Canada is the responsibility of the participant. In cases where special arrangements must be made, the Workshop organizers will arrange for letters of invitation to be sent to appropriate embassy officials, but such <b>requests must be made 45 days in advance</b> to assure timely completion of such arrangements.

<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Travel Stipends</font></h4>



There will be a limited amount of travel assistance available to defray the cost of attendance for participants who would otherwise be unable to attend.  As with previous workshops, participants or their institutions should expect to pay the majority of the costs of attendance.  Individuals with special circumstances that mitigate in favor of larger subsidies should contact the organizers directly with justification for the need. 





<h4><font color="#804000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weather / Clothing</font></h4>



Early October is a great time to visit Ottawa.  The weather in October varies from sunny to light rain with a temperature of 8.5&#176;C low to 17.12&#176;C high (47.3&#176;F low to 62.82&#176;F high). Light cotton clothing is recommended as is an umbrella / raincoat and a heavy jacket.
