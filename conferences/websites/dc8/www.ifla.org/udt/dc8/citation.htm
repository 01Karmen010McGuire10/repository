<h2><div align="center">AGENDA FOR DC-CITATION BREAK-OUT SESSION, <br>11-12:30 Thursday 5 October</div></h2>


<ol>
<li>Recommendations of WG following DC-7
<p>
See http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/1999-11/0025.html for
results of WG vote on recommendations. A summary is attached to this
agenda.
<p>
See also http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/ for full archive of DC-citation WG discussions, and
 http://epub.mimas.ac.uk/papers/appsmacecdl2000.html for Ann Apps' paper on the use of DC metadata in electronic journals.

<li>DC-CITE as a Dublin Core Structured Value (DCSV) set

See http://www.agcrc.csiro.au/projects/3018CO/metadata/dcsv/ for DCMI
Recommendation re DCSV syntax. (Note subsequent revision to use equal signs
instead of colons as separators between labels and values - referred to in
http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/2000-07/0005.html. Status of
DCSV as a Recommendation also called into question in the AC discussion
list, August.)
<p>
See http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/1999-12/0000.html for original proposal to use following labels for DC-CITE
as a DCSV (and follow subsequent discussion through the DC-citation archive):
<p>
JournalTitleFull; JournalTitleAbbreviated; Chronology; JournalVolume;
JournalIssueNumber; JournalPages.
<p>
Points for discussion at DC-8:
<ol type="a">
<li>semantics and definition of terms - are these the right terms? are they properly defined (see
http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/2000-06/0001.html and
subsequent discussion in archive)?

<li>should any of these elements be mandatory?

<li>controlled vocabulary re abbreviated titles - ISO standard recommended?

<li>syntax - escaped characters now OK?

<li>scope - academic journals? magazines? anything that fits?

<li>process for getting scheme endorsed and adopted - is DCSV a formal
recommendation? if so how do we get DC-CITE accepted as a DCSV set? will anyone take any notice? has the whole issue been sidelined by initiatives such as CrossRef, which uses an INDECS genre model (see
http://www.crossref.org for Technical Specifications)?

<li>further lobbying of DC Element WGs to implement full recommendations - do we have another go for dc:identifier.citation and
dc:description.release?
</ol>

<li>Conference proceedings
<ol type="a">
<li>Could these be accommodated in DC-CITE, or as another DCSV set, called DC-CONF?

<li>Core metadata for conferences - conference title, location and date: how do we deal with when these are i) the title of the resource, ii) part of the title of the resource, iii) not included in the title of the resource?

<li>Relationship with other conference proceedings metadata initiatives,
such as CrossRef and EPICS/ONIX (see
http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-citation/2000-08/0003.html for
comparison, and follow archive trail for further discussions on conference
proceedings and conferences themselves).
</ol>
</ol>
<h3>SUPPORTING MATERIAL</h3>
<ol>
<li>Recommendations following DC-7 - results of voting: summary
<ol type="i">
<li>Citation information (defined as "the bibliographic record") should be entered into dc:identifier. The record should include the page numbers, or equivalent locational information.

<li>There should be a specific Element Qualifier dc:identifier.citation to identify this information. (This recommendation was not supported by the Identifier WG.)

<li>The citation information should be structured. (This recommendation was followed up by the DCSV recommendation, DC-CITE, q.v.)

<li>"Chronology" (in the SICI-recognised sense of "cover date") should be indicated in dc:date. (There is some debate about whether dc:date.issued should use this date or the actual publication date. DCSV would take care of this more explicitly.)

<li>Edition/version/release information should be entered in dc:description, with its own qualifier, dc:description.release. (This recommendation was not supported by the Description WG.)

<li>"Journal article" should be a subcategory of "text" in dc:type. (The subcategories are being discussed by the Type WG.)
