      about metadata and applications, which are not limited to
      Dublin Core, and</p>

      <p>- to provide tutorial opportuities to increase
      understanding concerning the creation, management, and use of
      metadata applications.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>DC-2001 is the first event in the DC Workshop series to be
    hosted in Asia and is also the first event to provide
    conference tracks and tutorial tracks in addition to the workshop track.</p>
