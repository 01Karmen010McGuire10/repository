<h1>Call for Expressions of Interest for hosting DC-2010 in North America</h1>

<p>Published: 11 May 2009</p>
<p><b>Submission deadline: 8 June 2009</b></p>

<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is soliciting proposals for hosting the
2010 edition of the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata
Applications in North America in the period from early September to late
October 2010. This call for Expressions of Interests seeks to establish
contact with organizations that are interested in hosting this event.</p>

<p>DC-2010 will be the tenth of a series of conferences that started with
DC-2001 in Tokyo, Japan and has since been held in Florence (Italy), Seattle
(USA), Shanghai (China), Madrid (Spain), Manzanillo (Mexico), Singapore and
Berlin (Germany). DC-2009 will take place in Seoul, Korea, from 12 through
16 October 2009. For information on the conference series, see the
<a href="/workshops/">DCMI Conference and Workshop page</a>.</p>

<p>Expressions of Interest can be submitted by one organization or by a
consortium of cooperating organizations. One organization should be
identified as the lead organization. In line with the open and vendor-neutral
character of DCMI, DCMI is inviting public or not-for-profit organizations to
respond.</p>

<p>Proposals should indicate previous experience with similar events and should
outline approaches that will allow a successful conference.</p>

<p>DCMI would be interested to consider proposals that include innovative but
practical approaches for alternative delivery and participation methods such a
s &quot;amplified conference facilities&quot; or &quot;virtual
participation&quot;. This could range from live streaming of conference
sessions to interactive tools to enable remote participation in discussion
sessions.</p>

<p>Important criteria in the selection of proposals will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ease of access to conference location for an international audience</li>
<li>Quality of proposed venue and facilities</li>
<li>Proposers' experience with organizing international conferences</li>
<li>Prior involvement of proposers' staff in DCMI activities and attendance at
DCMI conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposers are invited to explicity address these criteria in the Expression
of Interest with supporting documentation and/or relevant links.</p>

<p>Expressions of Interest should be sent to Makx Dekkers, Managing Director of
DCMI at <b>mail (at) makxdekkers (dot) com</b>. The deadline for submission is
<b>Monday 8 June 2009, 23:59 UTC</b>. Any questions about this call can be sent
to the same address.<p>

<p>After receipt of an Expression of Interest, a detailed document outlining the
responsibilities and guidelines will be made available to the lead organization
identified in the Expression of Interest. Based on that document, we will enter
into more detailed discussions with respondents in order to come to a final
selection of the host, with the objective to be able to announce the host for
DC-2010 at DC-2009 in Seoul.</p>
