<h1 align=center>A Strawman Proposal for Metadata Extensibility</h1>
<p>
<h2>1. The Problem</h2>
Extensiblity means the ability to change or augment metadata standards
- either 'officially' (by changing the standard) or 'unofficially' (to
support local extensions). 
<p>
Extensions range from adding a new metadata element to creating an
entirely new metadata set.
<p>
Extensibility causes problems to both the human users of the metadata
system and to the software that supports them.
<p>
The human creating metadata first of all needs to be notified that
standard has changed, and then needs to be able to find out what the
changes mean. What values, for example, are legal in the new metadata
element? The human viewing metadata needs to be able to find out
what the information entered into the changed metadata elements
actually means.
<p>
Note that the human issues of extensibility are a special case of the
general problem of understanding metadata. In current systems, for
example, how does a new creator discover what metadata elements are
available for use and what data should be entered into them?
<p>
For software designers, the issue is how to reconfigure the software
used by metadata creation tools, metadata storage engines, and metadata
display programs to take into account the changed metadata standard.
For a widely distributed system this reconfiguration must be automatic
(or as close to automatic as possible). The economic cost of manual
reconfiguration is simply prohibitive, even if it were practicable.
<p>
Further, the ability to easily configure metadata software to handle
different metadata sets opens the possibility of metadata software which
can easily handle multiple metadata sets (even ones not yet defined).
This reduces the cost of the development of metadata systems and assists
in the introduction of such systems.
<p>
<h2>2. A Strawman Solution</h2>
<p>
The essence of metadata extensibility is the ability to electronically
publish a metadata schema. This allows metadata creators to understand
what information they should add to a set of metadata, and metadata
users to understand the meaning of the metadata sets they receive.
Representing this schema in a machine processable form
allows software to automatically adjust to new metadata elements.
<p>
The following strawman proposal has been based on the schema
specification system used in X.500. Experience has shown that this
system is very extensible; although with certain limitations. The
use of HTML to publish the schema is designed to address these
limitations.
<p>
A mechanism for linking a reference description of a metadata schema has
been proposed in <a href="#ref-dc">[1]</a>.
This proposal is simply an extension of this schema idea to address the
problems of extensibility.
<p>
This proposal is intended to broadly indicate how a metadata schema
system would work and what information it would contain. The examples
are <em>not</em> intended as syntax proposals. Nor is their any suggestion that
this is all that the schema would contain.
<p>
<h2>3. Metadata Schema Publishing</h2>
<p>
The basic approach is to include in each metadata set a URI pointing
to the metadata schema specification for that set. The specification
can be viewed as a more formal version of the document proposed in
<a href="#ref-dc">[1]</a>, so the same linkage mechanism could be used:
<p>
<tt>
&lt;LINK REL = SCHEMA.dc HREF = "http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core"&gt;
</tt>
</em>
<p>
which states that a set of Web pages describing the schema used to
construct this metadata set can be found at the specified URL. (A URN
would be preferable, but in the absence of a deployed URN scheme, URLs
will work.)
<p>
The structure of the pages pointed to by the metadataSchema URL are
shown in Figure 1.
<p>
The root page describes the metadata set as a whole, and includes lists
of metadata elements (attributes) which may and must be contained in the
set. Each metadata element has a page which describes the purpose of
that element, and links to pages which describe the syntax and semantics
of the element.
<p>
<h2>4. Metadata Set Schema</h2>
<p>
The page describing the Metadata Set would contain the following
information
<ul>
<li>The name of the metadata set
<li>The version and date
<li>A text description of the purpose of the metadata set
<li>A list of mandatory metadata elements
<li>A list of optional metadata elements
<li>A pointer to the formal standard describing the metadata
set (if one exists)
</ul>
<p>
The Dublin Core metadata set might be described in the following
example:
<p>
<em>
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set
Version 2 Date 15 January 1997
<p>
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is intended to describe document
like objects. This includes documents, maps, programs.
<p>
Mandatory Elements:
<p>
Optional Elements:
<ul>
<li>Title
<li>Creator (or Author)
<li>Subject (or Keywords)
<li>Description
<li>Publisher
<li>Contributors
<li>Date
<li>Type (Resource Type)
<li>Format
<li>Identifier (Resource Identifier)
<li>Source
<li>Language
<li>Relation
<li>Coverage
<li>Rights (Rights Management)
</ul>
<p>
The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is standardised in
http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements
</em>
<p>
<h2>5. Metadata Element Schema</h2>
<p>
A page describing a metadata element would contain the following
information
<ul>
<li>The name of the metadata element
<li>A textual description of the purpose of the metadata element
<li>An optional pointer to the syntax of the metadata element
<li>An optional list of semantics of the metadata element
<li>A pointer to the formal standard describing the metadata
element (if one exists)
</ul>
<p>
An example might be:
<p>
<em>
Language
<p>
Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource. Where
practical, the content of this field should coincide with the Z39.53
three character codes for written languages.
<p>
Syntax: String
<br>
Semantics: Z39.53
<br>
Standard: http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements
</em>
<p>
The metadata element schema has been separated from the page describing
the metadata set as a whole to allow individual metadata elements to be
referenced by multiple metadata set specifications.
<p>
<h2>6. Metadata Element Syntax Schema</h2>
<p>
This portion of the schema specifies syntactic limitations on metadata
values. For example, a metadata values may be limited to 'upper case
strings'.
<p>
A syntax instructs the user of the metadata set (human or machine) how
metadata values are represented. This allows values to be consistent
and aids machine processing and display of previously unrecognised
metadata elements.
<p>
At a basic level, a syntax is equivalent to a type in a programming
language. The basic syntaxes are strings, integers, floating point
numbers and booleans. Although most (all?) current metadata elements
would fall into one of these four basic syntaxes, it is likely that
more complicated, structured, syntaxes will be used in future (e.g. a
metadata element might contain a sequence of a string, an integer, and
then a further string).
<p>
The syntax may also specify limitations on the values over and above the
broad limitations of strings, integers, floats, and booleans. A string
might have a maximum number of characters or on the range of characters.
<p>
A page describing a metadata element syntax would contain the following
information
<ul>
<li>The name of the syntax
<li>A textual description of the syntax
<li>A textual description of the rules for comparing two values
<li>A formal description of the syntax
<li>A pointer to the formal standard describing the syntax
specification (if one exists)
</ul>
<p>
An example might be:
<p>
<em>
Telephone Number Syntax
<p>
A telephone number is a string of up to 32 characters which complies
with ITU recommendation E.123. Such a string has the following format:
<ul>
<li>A leading '+'
<li>The country code (e.g. '1' for the US)
<li>The area code (with no brackets or leading zero)
<li>The telephone number
</ul>
The telephone number may contain spaces.
An example telephone number is '+61 3 9282 2615'
<p>
Two telephone numbers are the same if they have the same digits in the
same order. Spaces are not significant.
</em>
<p>
The metadata element syntax has been separated from the metadata element
specification itself so that many metadata elements may share the same
syntax (e.g. fax machines are labeled by telephone numbers).
<p>
There is a close relation between the syntax and semantics of a metadata
element; both can control the values that can be placed in the metadata
element. The syntax is intended to be used to specify mechanical rules
controlling values (e.g. all characters must be in upper case). The
semantics are intended to control values by specifying meaning (e.g.
taxonomies). However, there is a large overlap and one or other might
be more appropriate in a particular case.
<p>
<h2>7. Metadata Element Semantic Schema</h2>
<p>
This portion of the schema specifies semantic limitations on metadata
values. For example, the values might be limitted to Library of
Congress subject headings.
<p>
A metadata element may have multiple semantic schemes (and so the actual
metadata element needs to contain a qualifier) specifying which scheme
is actually used.
<p>
A page describing metadata element semantics would contain the 
following information:
<ul>
<li>The name of the scheme
<li>A textual description of the scheme (possibly just referring to
the 'well known' standard)
<li>A pointer to the formal standard describing the semantics
(if one exists)
</ul>
<p>
The metadata element semantics have been separated from the metadata
element specification itself so that many metadata elements may share
the same semantics.
<p>
There is a close relation between the syntax and semantics of a metadata
element; both can control the values that can be placed in the metadata
element. The syntax is intended to be used to specify mechanical rules
controlling values (e.g. all characters must be in upper case). The
semantics are intended to control values by specifying meaning (e.g.
taxonomies). However, there is a large overlap and one or other might
be more appropriate in a particular case.
<p>
<h2>8. Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>
A set of pages describing a metadata scheme are useless if creators of
metadata sets do not know the URI of the page to include in the metadata
set. Possible methods of bootstrapping this knowledge include:
<ul>
<li>Discovery through Altavista like searching
<li>Discovery through metadata schema index pages
<li>Automatic inclusion via configuration of metadata generators
</ul>
<h2>9. Use of the Web Pages</h2>
The Web pages describing the metadata schema can be used in two ways:
<ul>
<li>As Help files.
The Web pages describe the metadata set, the metadata elements, and the
values that can be placed in metadata elements. The information in the
pages can be used as the source material for 'help' files to assist the
metadata creator and metadata user in creating or using a metadata
instance. These are more useful than on line standards because the
pages are logically segmented so that a user does not have to, for
example, retrieve (and read) the entire document when obtaining a help
for a particular attribute.
<li>As configuration files.
Although not shown in the examples in this proposal, the information in
the schema can also be encoded into a machine recognisable format and
included in the Web pages. When creating or using a metadata instances,
the software tool can retrieve the schema and use it as a configuration
file.
