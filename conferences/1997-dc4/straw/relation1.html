<H1>Using the Dublin Core relation Element</H1>

<HR>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<blockquote>
Relationship to other resources. The intent of specifying this element
is to provide a means to express relationships among resources that
have formal relationships to others, but exist as discrete resources
themselves. For example, images in a document, chapters in a book, or
items in a collection. 
</blockquote>


<h2>Justifications and Uses</h2>

Digital resources are rarely published in isolation.  Most are published
as part of a collection of related resources.  For example, HTML pages
are often published in hyper-linked webs, and images are often
published in thematic galleries.

<p>

Much intellectual effort is spent organising collections.  Part of
this organisation is a description of the relationships between
resources in the collection.  This organisation allows users to discover
resources in a structured way.  For example, users can browse through
a library collection using the subject headings in the catalog until
they find a subject of interest to them.

<p>

Some resources have their relationship to other resources embedded
within them. For example, a hypertext link within a HTML page
describes a relationship to another resource.  Other resources have no
facility for doing this.  The Dublin Core relation element is intended
to support the description of relationships to other resources within
the metadata for a resource.

<p>

Potential uses of the relation element include:
<ul>
  <li>allowing users to browse through resource collections using only
      metadata descriptions
  <li>aiding metadata indexing tools to decide on the value of
      resources (those with the most references)
</ul>

<h2>Other Work on Relations</h2>

The <a href="http://www.roads.lut.ac.uk/Metadata/DC-Qualifiers.html">ROADS
discussion document on Dublin Core Qualifiers</a> suggests a number of
qualifiers for Dublin Core elements, including the following TYPE
qualifiers for the relation element:

<ul>
  <li>IsParentOf
  <li>IsChildOf
  <li>IsMemberOf
  <li>IsDerivedFrom
  <li>HasBibliographicInfoIn
  <li>IsRevisionHistoryFor
  <li>IsCriticalReviewof
  <li>IsOverviewOf
  <li>IsContentRatingFor
  <li>IsTermsandConditionsFor
  <li>IsDataFor
</ul>

The <a
href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/profiles/collections.html">Z39.50
Profile for Access to Digital Collections</a> identifies that a given
digital resource may be related to resources which are

<ul>
  <li>duplicates or surrogates
  <li>superior or subordinate
  <li>related or provide context
</ul>

The <a
href="http://www.softquad.com/papers/draft-ietf-html-relrev-00.txt">Hypertext
links in HTML Internet draft</a> analyses the use of hypertext links
on the World Wide Web and provides suggestions for explicitly marking
up hypertext links with relationship descriptions.  It identifies a
number of categories of relationships:

<ul>
  <li>Navigation aids such as
      <ul>
	<li>contents - link to a table of contents
	<li>index - link to an index
      </ul>
  <li>Hierarchy links such as
      <ul>
	<li>child
	<li>sibling
	<li>top
      </ul>
  <li>Sequence links such as
      <ul>
	<li>begin
	<li>end
	<li>next
	<li>previous
      </ul>
  <li>Related links such as
      <ul>
	<li>biblioentry - bibliographic entry
	<li>glossary
      </ul>
</ul>

The <a href="http://www.omg.org/library/corbserv.htm">CORBA Relationship Service Specification</a> defines a very general
service for defining and manipulating relationships between
distributed resources.  This service is too general for our
requirements, but does identify four commonly used relationships:

<ul>
  <li>contains
  <li>contained_in
  <li>references
  <li>referenced_in
</ul>

<h2>A Strawman</h2>

Examining the relationship description techniques mentioned above, it
is obvious that the possible relationships between resources depend
heavily on the domain of the resources, and hence impossible to
enumerate all of them.  For that reason, this strawman proposal
suggests the definition of a core set of relationships which are
useful and understood in most domains.  Specialists in certain domains
may extend this core set, but should not expect the extensions to be
understood outside their domain.

<p>

Most of the relationship descriptions mentioned above allow
description of <strong>hierarchy</strong>,
<strong>containment</strong>, <strong>citation</strong>, and
<strong>context</strong> relationships.  The strawman proposal
suggests that these be used as the core set of relation qualifiers.

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>TYPE=IsParentOf
  <dd>The resource being described is higher in some arbitrary
      hierarchy than the resource being pointed to by this relation
      element.
  <dt>TYPE=IsChildOf
  <dd>The resource being described is lower in some arbitrary
      hierarchy than the resource being pointed to by this relation
      element.
</dl>

For example, in a web of HTML documents describing an organisations
departmental structure, a page describing a particular Unit may refer to the organisations home page.

<pre>
    RELATION (Scheme=URL) (Type=IsChildOf) http://www.dstc.edu.au/
</pre>

<h3>Containment</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>TYPE=Contains
  <dd>The resource being described contains the resource being pointed
      to by this relation element.
  <dt>TYPE=ContainedIn
  <dd>The resource being described is contained in the resource being pointed
      to by this relation element.
</dl>

For example, the metadata for a document which contains an image of an
albatross could include the relation element

<pre>
    RELATION (Scheme=URL) (Type=Contains)
      http://seabirds.com/albatross.gif
</pre>

<h3>Citation</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>TYPE=References
  <dd>The resource being described makes reference
      to the resource being pointed to by this relation element.
  <dt>TYPE=ReferencedIn
  <dd>The resource being described is refered to in
      the resource being pointed to by this relation element.
</dl>

For example, the metadata for this document could include a relation
element describing one the hypertext links:

<pre>
    RELATION (Scheme=URL) (Type=References)
      http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/profiles/collections.html
</pre>

<h3>Context</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>TYPE=RelatedTo
  <dd>The resource being described is somehow related to the resource
      pointed to by this relation element.  This is the default type
      value if the type is not explicitly stated.
</dl>

For example, the metadata for the albatross image could include a
relation element which pointed to a nesting albatross:

<pre>
    RELATION (Scheme=URL) (Type=RelatedTo)
      http://seabirds.com/albatross_nest.gif
</pre>
