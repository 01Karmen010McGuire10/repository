Canberra</A> is Australia's capital and forms the political and cultural
heart of the nation.  With its multitude of parks and gardens, the
national capital is particularly beautiful in spring and autumn.  The
average temperature in March ranges from 10C to 24C.  About 300,000
people live in Canberra, and the airport is 10km east of the city.
Buses connect city and suburban areas daily.  The Downtowner Tram
offers a free shuttle service Monday to Friday around the CBD.
Canberra is serviced by the major transport companies and airlines and
is an easy three hours drive from Sydney and a 50 minute flight from
Melbourne.

Canberra's centrepiece is Lake Burley Griffin, featuring the Captain
Cook Memorial Water Jet which flings a six-tonne column of water 140
metres into the air.  In Civic, on the northern side of the lake are
the shops, businesses, and <A HREF="http://www.anu.edu.au/"> Australian National
University</A>.  Parliamentary and other important
buildings are located to the south of the lake, surrounded by suburbs
such as Yarralumla, home to the Prime Minister and Governor-General.
