<h2>Status</h2> 

<P>This is a work in progress and a personal view of
the relationship between RDF and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiatives
data modeling activity.  This is not a formal publication of any DCMI
working group, or of the DCMI itself.  Nor is this complete...  
</P>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is a international
effort designed to foster consensus across disciplines for the
discovery-oriented description of diverse resources in an electronic
environment.  The DCMI has, in part and to this goal, defined the
Dublin Core Element Set (DCES) which is intended to support
cross-discipline resource discovery.  As a core set of concepts, the
DCES is not intended to satisfy every possible declarative need in
every discipline.  The requirement of providing the means for a
modular, extensible, metadata architecture to address local or
discipline-specific descriptive needs has been identified since the
very beginning of the DCMI work [WF]. The formalized representation of
this requirement has been the basis for the Dublin Core Data Model
activity.  This article provides an general overview of these function
requirements as well as an introduction to the supporting data model
and syntactic representation.</P>


<h2>DCMI Requirements</h2>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative element working groups have
primarily been focusing on semantic clarification of the DCES and the
identification of common cross-domain qualifiers to support richer
descriptive requirements.  While this focus has allowed rapid
conceptual development free of the constraints imposed by specific
syntactic or structural applications, this focus has placed an
additional burden on individual implementors. Specifically with
regards to the developement of internal mechanisms for encoding
properties define by the DCMI and local domain-specific properties;
mechanisms which are not always compatible with those of their
potential collaborators elsewhere [DCDM].</P> 

<P>The means for a formalized representation to support the encoding
needs for implementors has been the basis for the Dublin Core Data
Model activity. To facilitate the standardization of these
interoperable descriptive practices, a formal datamodel able to
support the requirements of the DCMI and a corresponding means of
syntactic represetnating this information is requireed.  In order to
develop such a model the identification of both implicit and explicit
requirements that are common across of the working group efforts are
necessary. The following are a basis for these functional
requirements:</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>Internationalization.</B> The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
has identified the requirement for defining the same descriptive
concepts in many different languages.</LI>

<LI><B>Modularization/Extensibility.</B> The Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative recognized early on that there would never be one "true"
declarative set of semantics to represent all resource descriptive
requirements.  As such, the ability to mix semantics defined in
various different communities may be necessary for supporting general
descriptive practices.</LI>

<LI><B>Element Identity.</B> It is important to clearly identify
elements defined by particular resource description communities. This
is useful both in understanding a particular context ('title' in the
context of Dublin Core Element Set) and to eliminate potential
name-collision (e.g. 'title' in the Dublin Core Element Set is different
than 'title in the VCARD specification).</LI>

<LI><B>Semantic Refinement.</B> Many of the Dublin Core elements
encompass broad concepts. It is useful to provides the means for
semantically refining such elements in order to say something much
more specific. (e.g. the property 'painter' as define by CIMI
(Consortium for the Computer Interchange of Museum Information) as a
semantic refinement of the concept 'contributor' as defined by the
DCMI). </LI>

<LI><B>Identification of encoding schemes.</B> The ability to specify a
particular encoding scheme is critical to the interpretation of some
types of metadata.  Dates, for example are written in different
formats in different places.  Ambiguity can be resolved by identifying
the encoding format in which the date is encoded.  </LI>

<LI><B>Specification of controlled vocabularies.</B> Many disciplines use
classification schemes, controlled vocabularies or thesauri to
describe the content of resources.  Creators of metadata need to be
able to specify such schemes so as to leverage this important class of
tools. The Dewey Decimal System, Medical Subject Headings, the Art and
Architecture Thesaurus are examples, but there are many others.</LI>

<LI><B>Identification of structured compound values.</B> The use of
compound structures as values of metadata is important to many
communities, including the use of authority records for authorized
versions of the names of subjects, places, corporate entities, and
people.</LI>

</UL>

<P>A formal definition and systematic representation of these require
are a necessary component for supporting interoperability across
implementors. The formalized representation of these requirement has
been the basis for the Dublin Core Data Model activity.  The following
sections outline the basic nature of this model and how this
work addressing the outlined functional requirements defined by the DCMI.</P>



<h2>The Basic Dublin Core Data Model</h2>

<P>In order to address these requirements a formal model is required
to facilitate the representation and declaration that satisfy these
needs.  Early in this work, it was recognized that standards were
required across the web for the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative to
succeed as a global level. As such, the generalization of these
functional requirements defined by the DCMI were, in part, the basis
behind the development of the W3C's Resource Description Framework
(RDF), the metadata architecture for the web. The basis for the Dublin
Core Data Model is built simply on the foundation model defined by
RDF. In essence, it is simply the following:</P>

<pre class='assertion'>
There are resources in the world that we would like to describe.
These resources have properties associated with them. The values of
these properties can be literals (e.g. string-values) or other
resources.
</pre>

Now, with any other basic data model, clarification and examples of
this basic model are required.

<pre class='assertion'>
A resource can be anything that can be uniquely identified.
</pre>

<P>A resource can be anything that has identity. Familiar examples
include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's
weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other
resources. Not all resources are network "retrievable"; e.g., human
beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be
considered resources [RFC2396].  The granular identification of a
resource, however, (web site, web page on a site, image in a web page, etc.) is
application specific and has no bearing on the underlying model.</P>

<pre class='assertion'>
Properties are specific types of resources.
</pre>

<P>The Dublin Core Element Set defines a set properties and associated
semantics that are common to many resource description
communities. The DCMI is declaring additional properties for richer
descriptions (e.g. qualifiers) and domain specific needs
(dc-education, dc-libraries, dc-government, dc-business, etc.). Each
property defined will have unique identify along with at human
readable labels and clear semantic definitions.  Each property
declared may additionally define permitted values, the types of
resources it can describe, and/or its relationship (e.g. 'semantic
refinement') with other properties.</P>

<pre class='assertion'>
Classes of objects are specific types of resources.
</pre>

<P>The Dublin Core Element Set [DCES] loosely defined the notion of a
"DLO" at the first Dublin Core Workshop. This loose concept was
intentional due to the desire to scope discussions and focus on common
semantic properties that exist across classes of objects, rather than
the specific classes themselves.  As the DCMI has evolved, it seems
clear that both the declaration of properties that are common across
objects and the declaration of common classes of objects are useful in
the practical use and reuse across many descriptive communities. </P>

<pre class='assertion'>
Literal are terminal resources.
</pre>

<P>Literals are simple text strings. Literals may have structured
content but are not further evaluated by the modeling processor. </P>

<P>This simple model is basis for very powerful expressions. In order
to communicate this model among applications, a common syntactic
means for transmitting this information is required.  For this
communication, a XML representation of the RDF datamodel is
defined. The application of the datamodel in terms of the requirements
defined by DCMI are the focus of the remaining sections of this
article.</P>


<h2>Addressing Functional Requirements</h2>

<h3>Element Identity</h3>

<P>When we write a sentence in natural language we use words that are
meant to convey a certain meaning. That meaning is crucial to how
humans understanding the statements and, in the case of applications
on the web, is critical to establishing that the correct processing
occurs as intended. It is very important that both the writer and the
reader of a statement understand the same meaning for the terms used,
such as 'Creator', 'approvedBy', 'Copyright', etc. or confusion will
result. In a medium of global scale such as the World Wide Web it is
not sufficient to rely on shared cultural understanding of concepts
such as "creatorship"; it pays to be as precise as
possible. [RDFMS]</P>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has defined a core set of
semantics in the declaration of the DCES. The DCMI is currently
defining additional semantics in the declaration of the qualifier
work and domain-specific (dc-education, dc-libraries, dc-government)
initiatives.  The expression of these semantics is through the
reference to a schema. A schema can be viewed as a kind of dictionary
which uniquely identifies the terms and provides the means for
specifying semantics. A variety of schema forms can be used with
RDF, including a specific form defined in a separate document
[RDFSchema] that has some specific characteristics to help with
automating tasks using RDF.</P>

<P>Utilizing declarative mechanisms defined by RDF schemas, the
semantics defined by the Dublin Core Metadata initiative can be uniquely
identified and described. Thus a given resource uniquely identified by
the URI 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/' can within it declare the
following:</P>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;!-- declarations in resource http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ --&gt;

&lt;rdfs:Property rdf:ID = "contributor"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:label&gt; Contributor &lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; An entity responsible for making contributions to the content of the resource. &lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Property&gt;
...
</pre>

<p>Thus providing the semantic "'contributor' as defined by the Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative" that can be uniquely identified by the URI
http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor.</P>


<h3>Modularity/Extensibility</h3>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative recognized early on that there
would never be one "true" declarative set of semantics to represent
all resource descriptive requirements.  As such, semantics defined in
various different communities may be used for supporting descriptive
practices. In order to avoid confusion between independent (and
possibly conflicting) definitions of the same term, RDF uses the XML
namespace facility. Namespaces are simply a way to tie a specific use
of a word in context to the dictionary (schema) where the intended
definition is to be found. As such, the DCMI's requirement providing
the ability to mix semantics defined in various different communities
is accomplished using this mechanism.  A simple example of this is as
follows:</P>

<pre class='example'>
...
xmlns:dc = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
xmlns:agls = "http://www.naa.gov.au/govserv/agls/vocab/"
...
...
&lt;dc:contributor&gt; Ned Kelly &lt;/dc:contributor&gt;
&lt;agls:jurisdiction&gt; Australia &lt;/agls:jurisdiction&gt;
...
</pre>

<p>This simple example uses the DCMI vocabulary (as defined by the
semantics declared in 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/') and an AGLS
Australian Government Locater Service vocabulary (as defined by the
semantics declared in 'http://www.naa.gov.au/govserv/agls/vocab/') for
describing a given resource. More specifically, based on rules defined
by XML namespace, this example uses the elements 'contributor' (as
defined by 'http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor') and
'jurisdiction' (as defined by
'http://www.naa.gov.au/govserv/agls/vocab/jurisdiction'). The use of
XML namespaces in conjunction with a common declarative mechanisms
defined by RDF allow for the inclusion of modular semantic
vocabularies for the description of resources. </P>


<h3>Semantic Refinement</h3>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative additional recognized early on
that various communities may choose to utilize richer semantic
definitions that those provided by the Dublin Core Element Set in
their descriptions.  A requirement that evolved form this recognition
was the need for making explicit relations between these richer semantics
and those of the Dublin Core Element Set.  The statement that
"Michaelangelo" is the "cimi:painter" (and as such the
"dc:contributor") of the "Sistine Chapel" is such an example.  This
type of "semantic refinement" as defined by DCMI was
additionally conveyed to the RDF Schema working group.  Recognizing
this was a common problem among many applications, this RDF Schema
group introduced a mechanism to support such a relationship of
"semantic refinement".</P>

<pre class="example">
&lt;!-- declarations in resource http://www.cimi.org/vocab/ --&gt;

&lt;rdfs:Property rdf:ID = "painter"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:label&gt; Painter &lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/contributor" /&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Property&gt;
</pre>

<P>The RDF mechanism "rdfs:subPropertyOf" provides a powerful means of
declaring relations among different vocabularies. Thus when an RDF
processor interprets the following metadata instance data:</P>

<pre class="example">
...
xmlns:cimi = "http://www.cimi.org/vocab/"
...
...
&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about = "URI:MID:MEDICI/vatican/sistine_chapel"&gt;
  &lt;cimi:painter&gt; Michalangelo &lt;/cimi:painter&gt;
&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
...
</pre>

<P>Such processor would recognize the sub-type relationship that
exists between these two semantic declarations.  This recognition, in
essence, allows for an RDF application to know that "Michaelangelo" is
the "cimi:painter" (and to infer a "dc:contributor") of the "Sistine
Chapel".  Utilizing this RDF Schema mechanism is a powerful way of
representing the Dublin Core's notion of "semantic refinement" and as
such satisfies this requirement. </P>


<h3>Encoding Schemes and Controlled Vocabularies</h3>

<P>The ability to specify a particular encoding scheme is critical to
the interpretation of some types of metadata.  As mentioned earlier,
dates, for example, are written in different formats in different
places.  The DCMI recommendation for date encoding [W3CDTF] is a
simplified derivative of the ISO 8601 date encoding standard, but a
given application could specify an alternate encoding for local
purposes. Ambiguity between these (and other similar cases) can be
resolved by identifying the encoding format in which the date is
encoded.</P>

<P>A useful mechanism for identifying a particular encoding scheme is
through the concept of 'data-typing'. Data typing is the notion
providing a mechanism for the analysis and/or constraint matching to
ensure validity or conformance of a particular value. In RDF, we can
defined a data-type in terms of a class declaration.  </P>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;!-- declarations in resource http://purl.org/dc/elements/2.0/ --&gt;

&lt;rdfs:Class rdf:ID = "DDC"&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:label&gt; Dewey Decimal Classification &lt;/rdfs:label&gt;
  &lt;rdfs:comment&gt; A concept defined by the Dewey Deciaml Classification System &lt;/comment&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:Class&gt;
...
</pre>

<P>And reuse this in the following desciption to providing a mechanism
for the analysis and/or constraint matching of the particular defualt
value (identified by the reserve RDF semantic 'rdf:value').</P>


<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;dc:subject&gt;
  &lt;dcq:DDC&gt;
    &lt;rdf:value&gt;300.435&lt;/rdf:value&gt;
  &lt;/dcq:DDC&gt;
&lt;/dc:subject&gt;
...   
</pre>

<P>Many disciplines additionally use classification schemes,
controlled vocabularies or thesauri to describe the content of
resources.  Creators of metadata need to be able to specify such
schemes so as to leverage existing knowledge structures. The Dewey
Decimal System, Medical Subject Headings, the Art and Architecture
Thesaurus are examples, but there are many others.</P>

<P>The same data-typing mechanism for identifying a particular
encoding scheme can be leveraged for the use of the identification of
controlled vocabulary. The following, for example, utilizes the same
data-type declration, but using additional referencing RDF provides,
uniqly identified the particular DDC concept and provides the ability
to derefernece this concept and learn more about. </P>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;dc:subject&gt;
  &lt;dcq:DDC rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/ddc/21/300.435" /&gt;
&lt;/dc:subject&gt;
...   
</pre>

<P>This example, in essence, offers the ability of exposing controlled
vocabulary in ways that allow for the additional understanding of
contextual information.</P>


<h3>Compound Values</h3>

<P> The use of compound structures as values of metadata is important
to many communities, including the use of authority records for
authorized versions of the names of subjects, places, corporate
entities, and people.  In actuality, these subjects, places, entities,
etc. are simply resources with particular characteristics or
properties associated with them.  The notion that these resources may
be combined in various descriptive ways (and specifically as the value
associated with a property defined by the DCES) is derivative of the
term 'compound value'.  A 'person' for example may have a name, email
address, affiliation, etc. Properties characteristic of a particular
individual. These characteristics are independent of weather this
person is the 'creator', 'publisher' or 'subject' associated with some
other resource.  </P>

<P>And the resource dereferenced at location
http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org would be:</P>

<pre class='example'>
...
xmlns:ev = "http://purl.org/laf/entities/vocab/" &gt;
...
&lt;ev:Person rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org"&gt;
  &lt;ev:name&gt; Eric J. Miller &lt;/ev:name&gt;
  &lt;ev:eid&gt; 2325 &lt;/ev:eid&gt;  
  &lt;ev:affiliation&gt; OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. &lt;/ev:affiliation&gt;
  &lt;ev:email&gt; emiller@oclc.org &lt;/ev:email&gt;  
&lt;/ev:Person&gt;
...
`</pre>

<P>As such, this resource could be used in a variety of descriptions
and descriptive manners:</P>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;dc:creator rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org" /&gt;
..
</pre>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;epinions:endorsedBy rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org" /&gt;
..
</pre>

<P>A confusion has surfaced with regards to the relationship between
vocabularies that are defined by the DCMI and other vocabularies when
describing compound values. In essence, this is the relation of two
separate descriptions.  Thus the following syntactic representation
describing the person (identified by
'http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org') who is a contributor
to a resource (identified by 'URL'):</P>

<pre class='example'>
...
&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about = "URL"&gt;
&lt;dc:contributor&gt;
  &lt;dcq:Person rdf:resource = "http://purl.org/laf/entities/emiller@oclc.org" /&gt;
    &lt;rdf:value&gt; Eric Miller &lt;/rdf:value&gt;
  &lt;dcq:Person&gt;
&lt;/dc:contributor&gt;
..
</pre>

<P>can be graphically represented in the following:</P>

<P><img src = "dcdm-compound.gif" /></P>

<P>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is currently identifying and
provding semantics for a core set of types of resource (people,
corporation, place, etc.) that will facilitate the description
of electronic resource. Additionally, since there are so many existing
ways of describing these classes of resources, the DCMI is also
considering a simple set of characteristics that may be used to
minimally facilitate the discovery and description of these resources. </P>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<P>A formalized data model is required to support the DCMI functional
requirement for a modular, extensible, metadata architecture.  ...</P>
