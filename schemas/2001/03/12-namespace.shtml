<p><b>Glossary: </b></p>
<p>The following are defined terms in this document:</p>
<p><b>DCMI recommendations<br />
  </b>A <i>DCMI recommendation</i> is a document written for human reading that 
  is the final result of the approval process for <i>DCMI terms</i>.</p>
<p><b>DCMI terms<br />
  </b>The phrase<i> DCMI terms </i>is used to denote names of elements or qualifiers 
  identified in <i>DCMI recommendations</i> and systems.  Each <i>DCMI term</i> 
  is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier within the DCMI namespace.</p>
<p><b>DCMI term declarations<br />
  </b>A <i>DCMI term declaration </i>is the machine-processable representation 
  of a <i>DCMI term</i>, expressed in a schema language and maintained in the 
  <i>DCMI registry.</i></p>
<p><b>DCMI registry<br />
  </b>The <i>DCMI registry </i>is the software repository of <i>DCMI term declarations</i> 
  for all <i>DCMI terms.</i></p>
<p><b>DCMI metadata packages<br />
  </b>A <i>DCMI metadata package </i>is a discrete collection of <i>DCMI terms</i> 
  identified as a group for management purposes.  Each <i>DCMI package </i>has 
  its own sub-namespace within the DCMI registry namespace.</p>
<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>The use of URI-based namespaces for formal, machine-processable declarations 
  of metadata entities is a convention intended to support web-addressable concepts 
  that can be shared across applications, and hence promote the possibility of 
  shared semantics.  DCMI adopts this convention for the identification of all 
  DCMI terms.  This document identifies the policies and procedures associated 
  with the naming of existing DCMI terms and those that will be defined in the 
  future.</p>
<h3>II. Relation of DCMI term declarations to DCMI recommendations</h3>
<p>DCMI Recommendations are human-readable documents that describe the end products 
  of the process of proposing, discussing, revising, and approving DCMI terms.  
  These documents constitute the primary deliverables of the initiative and can 
  be used to communicate the definitions of DCMI terms and related architectural 
  issues to interested readers.  The consensus-driven agreements articulated in 
  these documents are encoded in a schema language in order to support machine-processable 
  declarations that can be useful to software applications.  The DCMI registry 
  is the authoritative repository of all such declarations for terms managed by 
  the initiative.</p>
<h3>III. Namespace declarations used by DCMI for DCMI registry declarations</h3>
<p>The namespace of the Dublin Core metadata element set (version 1.1) is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Declarations for individual elements are constructed by adding #<i>entity_name</i>, 
  for example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/#title</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>is the web-addressable identifier for one of the 15 elements of the Dublin 
  Core metadata element set.  Each of the 15 elements can be so identified.  Stability 
  of namespace identifiers for metadata terms is critical to interoperability 
  over time. Thus, the wide promulgation of this set of identifiers dictates that 
  they be maintained to support legacy applications that have adopted them.</p>
<p>As DCMI registry infrastructure evolves, it will become the repository of the 
  canonical definitions of all DCMI terms (in the form of schema declarations 
  that are machine-processable, but also can provide human-readable definitions).  
  Thus, three currently approved DCMI metadata packages have the following namespaces:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dces<br />
    </code><code>http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dcq<br />
    </code><code>http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dctype</code></p>
  </blockquote>
<p>Official declarations for all additional metadata packages approved by DCMI, 
  including additional elements, qualifiers and domain specific metadata packages, 
  are specified as</p>
<p>http://dublincore.org/<i>YYYY/MM/DD</i>-<i>package_identifier</i>/[<i>#term_name</i>]</p>
<p>Thus, subcomponents of DCMI namespace Identifiers include the following components:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>protocol identifier</td>
    <td>http://</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DCMI Domain</td>
    <td>dublincore.org/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>YYYY/MM/DD</td>
    <td>a date-stamp identifying the date of instantiation of the package in the 
      registry software</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>package_identifier string</td>
    <td>a dash-delimited string identifying the DCMI metadata package in which 
      a given set of DCMI terms are aggregated</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>term_name string </td>
    <td>a hash-delimited string identifying the name of the DCMI term</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>It is important to recognize that the date-stamp component should not be construed 
  as a version identifier or even as a date-stamp identifying the inclusion of 
  a given term in a given DCMI metadata package, but rather as an administrative 
  device signaling the instantiation of a given package.</p>
<h3>IV. DCMI metadata declarations in multiple languages</h3>
<p>DCMI terms must have a single URI within the DCMI registry to assure unambiguous 
  identity, however DCMI terms are rendered in many different languages and character 
  sets.  It is a functional requirement of a multi-lingual metadata registry such 
  as the DCMI registry that an application be able to issue a service request 
  to the registry to return the attributes of a given term in any of the languages 
  and character sets in which it has been encoded.</p>
<h3>V. Policy concerning classes of changes to DCMI terms</h3>
<p>Changes to DCMI terms or term declarations will occur from time to time for 
  a variety of reasons. Such changes have varying implications for namespace declarations.  
  The following classes of changes are identified along with examples and associated 
  implications for namespaces.</p>
<h4>A. Minor editorial errata</h4>
<p>Errors of spelling, punctuation, or other clerical mistakes discovered in the 
  DCMI registry will be corrected without public notification or comment period, 
  as long as, in the judgment of the DCMI directorate, there are no implications 
  for negative impact on users or applications that rely on DCMI term declarations.</p>
<p>Correction of minor editorial errata will result in no changes in namespaces 
  within the DCMI registry.</p>
<h4>B. Substantive editorial errata</h4>
<p>Errors of substance discovered in the DCMI registry will trigger public notification 
  of the correction to the general information email server (DC-General).   Errors 
  that, in the judgment of the DCMI Directorate, compromise the immediate usefulness 
  or accuracy of DCMI metadata systems will be corrected immediately (for example, 
  an incorrect URL to a resource external to DCMI).  Others will be corrected 
  following a 14-day public comment period to assure that changes do not adversely 
  effect systems or applications which rely on the DCMI namespace infrastructure.</p>
<p>Correction of substantive editorial errata will result in no changes in namespaces 
  within the DCMI registry.</p>
<h4>C. Semantic changes in DCMI terms</h4>
<p>Changes of definitions of DCMI terms will be reflected in metadata registry 
  declarations as a result of a formal approval process within DCMI. If, in the 
  judgment of the DCMI Directorate, such changes of meaning are likely to have 
  substantial impact on either machine processing of DCMI terms or the functional 
  semantics of the terms, then these changes will be reflected in a change of 
  namespace identifier for the DCMI term or terms in question.</p>
<h4>D. Changes in approval status</h4>
<p>A DCMI term can have one of several approval statuses as defined by the DCMI 
  Usage Board. (<i>proposed, conforming, recommended, obsolete</i> are currently 
  under discussion).  Changes in approval status represent annotation on the DCMI 
  term declarations.  It is a functional requirement of the DCMI registry to respond 
  to a service request querying the approval status of a DCMI term for any date 
  within the operational interval of the registry.</p>
<p>Changes in approval status have no impact on namespace identifiers for DCMI 
  terms</p>
<h4>E. Addition of DCMI term declarations to existing DCMI metadata packages</h4>
<p>New elements or qualifiers will from time to time be added to existing DCMI 
  metadata packages.  Such additions will be uncommon for, for example, the Dublin 
  Core element set, and somewhat more frequent for packages that are lists of 
  controlled terms such as the DC Type list.</p>
<p>Addition of DCMI terms to existing packages will not trigger changes in namespace 
  identifiers.</p>
<h4>F. Addition of new packages to the DCMI metadata registry</h4>
<p>DCMI terms are packaged in collections of terms that have DCMI metadata package 
  identifiers as part of their namespace identifiers.  New packages will be added 
  to the DCMI registry as the result of approval of additional collections of 
  DCMI terms.</p>
<h4>VI. Archival time series of registry status</h4>
<p>It is a functional requirement of the DCMI registry that a service request 
  to the registry with a parameter of any date within the interval of operation 
  of the registry shall return the state of the registry and all DCMI terms on 
  that date.</p>
