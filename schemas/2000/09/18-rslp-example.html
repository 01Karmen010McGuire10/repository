    <h1>RSLP Collection Description XML/RDF Example</h1>

    <P>Andy Powell, Michael Heaney, and Lorcan Dempsey wrote a very
    nice article regarding <A href =
    "http://www.dlib.org/dlib/september00/powell/09powell.html">the
    creation, description and management of collections</A>.  The
    syntactic example they use is slightly problematic from the
    standpoint of not being <A HREF =
    "http://www.w3.org/RDF">XML/RDF</A> complient.  Additionally, the
    example does not incorporate the Dublincore notion of of encoding
    schemes as modelled by RDF classes (e.g. Data Types) and reflected
    in the (not yet approved: 20000918) <a href = "http://dublincore.org/2000/03/13-dcq">Dublin
    Core Qualified Schema</A>.</P>

    <P>The following document is designed to begin to address what it
    means to bring this example into RDF and DCQ (as modeled as an RDF
    Schema) semantic and syntactic complience.... More details on this is required.</P>

    <P>Until this detail has been added... the following angley-bracket examples will hopefully illustrate thes issues:
    <A HREF = "http://admin.dublincore.org/source/browse/admin/www/2000/09/18-rslp-example.xml?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">The original RDF/XML Example</A>, the example

    <A HREF =    "http://admin.dublincore.org/source/browse/admin/www/2000/09/18-rslp-example.xml?rev=1.3&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">modified</A>

    and the <A href =
    "http://admin.dublincore.org/source/browse/admin/www/2000/09/18-rslp-example.xml.diff?r1=text&tr1=1.1&r2=text&tr2=1.3&f=h">differences</A>between
    the original example and updated one.
      </P>
