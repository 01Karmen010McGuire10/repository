    <h1>Building Blocks for the Semantic Web</h1>

    <p>Stuart Weibel and Eric Miller <a

    Initiative</a></p>

    <h2>Simplicity and Utility are Keys to the Future of the
    Web</h2>

    <p>The Web is an important universal information tool,
    embracing vast stores of information with many purposes ,
    multiple disparate sources, , and quite a few unpredictable
    users. There is a clear need to improve access to this polyglot
    of information and for the development of better search,
    retrieval and organizational tools.</p>

    <p>Metadata (or data about data), is a fundamental part of the
    solution to this challenge. Effective use of metadata requires
    three things: A set of commonly-understood terms to describe
    the content of information resources (semantics), a standard
    grammar for connecting those terms in meaningful metadata
    sentences and a framework that allows us to exchange and
    recombine those metadata sentences across different
    applications and subject. These three elements &ndash;
    standardized semantics, a definitive syntax, and a framework
    for exchange &ndash; provide an architecture for resource
    description that can work across all subject areas within the
    Web sphere.</p>

    <p>Developing a single andcomplete vocabulary for resource
    description is a difficult problem. Tackling this effort in a
    flexible fashion, however, allows for a step-by-step solution
    with manageable sub-parts. Lego, the familiar building blocks
    of childhood, is the perfect metaphor for describing how
    metadata can be incorporated into the Web to support the
    management of information. Lego blocks come in themes,
    consisting of simple colored bricks created with consistent,
    engineered dimensions that allow them to snap together with a
    satisfying <i>click</i>.</p>

    <p>The <a
    href="http://purl.org/dc/documents/rec-dces-19990702.htm">Dublin
    Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES)</a> can be viewed as the
    common semantic building block of Web metadata. Its 15 broad
    categories (elements) are useful for creating simple,
    easy-to-understand descriptions for most information resources.
    Most communities need additional semantics to fully describe
    their resources, however. So, just as simple Lego blocks can be
    combined to form complex structures, various modules of
    metadata can be combined to form more complex descriptions. The
    DCMES is the basic block, but other chunks of metadata can be
    combined with it to form richer descriptions.</p>

    <p>The basic element set is intended to capture most of the
    basic descriptive categories necessary to promote effective
    search and retrieval. Additional building blocks can be created
    to provide modular chunks of metadata that can be built into
    richer descriptions for information resources. So, just as Lego
    blocks of various shapes can be snapped together to form
    undersea exploration themes or recombined to create spaceships
    or medieval castles, chunks of metadata can be combined and
    recombined to meet the functional requirements of different
    applications .</p>

    <h2>Metadata Modularity on the Web</h2>

    <p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative provides a forum for the
    definition of semantics, both for a general description core
    and for subject-specific extensions. How can these vocabularies
    be integrated into a functional architecture? Dublin Core
    metadata can be carried in <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp">HTML</a>, <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/XML">XML</a>, and <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/RDF">RDF</a>. The latter, the Resource
    Description Framework, builds on the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C)</a>
    effort to design an architecture for metadata on the Web. RDF
    supports many different metadata needs of vendors and
    information providers. If Dublin Core Metadata Element Set can
    be thought of as a Lego that is common to many sets, RDF is the
    engineering standard that enables that satisfying <i>click</i>
    when the blocks are snapped together.</p>

    <p>RDF helps create an infrastructure that will support the
    combination of Dublin Core modules into larger, more expressive
    metadata structures that will work interoperably with one
    another. Further, applications should be able to mix metadata
    from other semantic standards expressed in RDF as well. Just as
    different Lego sets express undersea, outerspace or medieval
    castle themes, RDF can help make it possible to snap together
    modules that support metadata themes for education, government
    or commercial purposes, all working together in the same
    architecture For example, the members of the <a
    href="http://www.egroups.com/group/rss-dev">RSS community</a>
    have recently been advocating RDF as a powerful modular means
    of combining semantics defined by Dublin Core with additional
    vocabularies (syndication, aggregation, threading) to produce a
    simple means for effectively providing site summaries and
    syndication services. An example of how this might be used as a
    modular means for combining semantics follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF
   xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rss="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/"
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"&gt;
  &lt;rss:channel rdf:about="http://www.xml.com/xml/news.rss"&gt;
    &lt;rss:title&gt;XML.com&lt;/rss:title&gt;
    &lt;rss:link&gt;http://xml.com/pub&lt;/rss:link&gt;
    &lt;dc:description&gt;XML.com features a rich mix of information and
services for the XML community.  &lt;/dc:description&gt;
    &lt;dc:subject&gt;XML, RDF, metadata, information syndication services&lt;/dc:subject&gt;

    <h2>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative -- creating the
    semantic building blocks of the Web</h2>

    <p>The mission of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) is
    to make it easier to find resources using the Internet through
    the following activities:</p>

    <p>Developing metadata standards for resource search and
    retrieval across different subject areas</p>

    <p>Defining frameworks for the interoperability of metadata
    sets</p>

    <p>Facilitating the development of community- or
    subject-specific metadata sets that work within these
    frameworks</p>

    <p>The Dublin Core metadata element set, (or the basic Lego
    brick), is intended to support cross-subject search and
    retrieval. It can be thought of as a simplistic or pidgin
    metadata language that helps the user navigate through
    disparate subjects, languages, and cultures. Adoption of the
    Dublin Core by governments, libraries, museums, archives,
    publishers, environmental science repositories, print and
    e-print archives, to name a few, testifies to its success in
    this role. There are emerging applications in the commercial
    sector, as well, with health care organizations and financial
    industries using the Dublin Core as the basis for organizing
    and exchanging information.</p>

    <p>Part of the mission of DCMI is to provide a vendor-neutral
    forum for the development of additional vocabularies that are
    interoperable within the broader architecture of the Dublin
    Core and other Web metadata schemas in general. At the recent
    8<sup>th</sup> Dublin Core metadata workshop in Ottawa, Canada,
    a special interest group formed around the exploration of
    metadata issues that are of particular interest to the <a
    href="http://purl.org/dc/groups/biz.htm">business
    community</a>. The provisional charter for this group is as
    follows:</p>

    <p>To provide a forum:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To investigate metadata schemas used in commercial
      business models</li>

      <li>(Business-to-Business, Business-to-Consumer);</li>

      <li>2) To promote the use of Dublin Core in internal and
      cross company business environments;</li>

      <li>3) To identify business sectors and commercial resources
      (e.g. information, services, catalogs, products) that could
      benefit from the use of the DC standard;</li>

      <li>4) To highlight within the DC Community the commercial
      ramifications of DC developments ;</li>

      <li>5) To discuss the possible expansion of Dublin Core to
      accommodate information vital to commercial requirements and
      uses.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Other activities of the Initiative</h2>

    <p>In addition to providing international forums for the
    development of vendor-neutral vocabularies, the DCMI is
    promoting the development of tools and infrastructure to
    support high quality metadata applications on the Net,
    including:</p>

    <p>a semantic registry to store and search declared meanings
    and their relationships to other meanings; and</p>

    <p>an open source software repository to provide the tools for
    creating, editing, managing and navigating metadata.</p>

    <p>The registry activity is a fundamental part of both the
    management and use of metadata, allowing, in the short term,
    the registration and public disclosure of metadata schemas at a
    granularity that allows management and discovery of descriptors
    at the element level. Metadata schema developers will use the
    registry to discover what other applications have adopted. User
    will be able to identify the precise definitions of elements,
    and applications will be able to resolve machine-processable
    mappings among different schemas, further enhancing the
    prospects for Web-wide metadata interoperability.</p>

    <p>By supporting the development of such tools in an open
    source environment, the DCMI hopes to promote broad
    contribution of value by the community at large.</p>

    <p>While the Dublin Core began with the goal of developing a
    simple, interoperable, extensible, consensus-built metadata
    standard, it has evolved beyond a basic element set to embrace
    new communities and subject areas. The Dublin Core Metadata
    Initiative has become a home for a broad spectrum of subject
    experts and metadata practitioners, built on community trust
    and open consensus building, and motivated by a desire to build
    a Web of greater coherence.</p>
