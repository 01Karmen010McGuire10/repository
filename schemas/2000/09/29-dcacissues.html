    <h3>Normalizing DCMI vocabulary documents</h3>
<pre>
[[[
As we could have guessed, the case issue (capital verse lower case) of the 
semantics defined by the DCMI as well as the difference in declarative 
terminology across documents is causing significant confusion to developers. 
As such, my suggestion is to re-format the semantic declarations in the 
Element Set document [3] to reflect the declarative conventions defined by 
the dc-usage committee which are reflected in the Qualifiers recommendation 
[4] and the DC Education proposal [5].

    <h3>Naming policy for DCMI namespaces</h3>
<pre>
[[[
Namespaces are required for identifying schemas required for various XML 
and/or RDF applications. Independent of the domain name discussion (e.g. 
whether to use http://purl.org/dc/ or http://www.dublincore.org)/), a common 
policy for naming namespaces defined by the DCMI is useful.

    <h3>DC URIs</h3>
<pre>
[[[
Can someone clarify which one is preferred and can we try and stick to it 
in all places. I note that www.dublincore.org redirects to purl.org/DC, 
though the purl.org/dc form used in current namespace URIs. 

What is the current thinking on more public use of www.dublincore.org?

    <h3>DCMI Encoding Schemes</h3>
<pre>
[[[
"NOTICE TO IMPLEMENTORS: 
The syntax examples included in this document are provisional, and are currently 
under review as part of the DCMI work on recommending coordinated syntax 
recommendations for HTML, XML, and RDF. These recommendations and 
minor editorial changes in this document can be expected to take place in the near 
future." 

so I'm wondering if we should go right ahead and make this change NOW before 
there are too many more implementations relying on the older ":" delimited notation? 
I could very quickly update the Rec's to this effect if the AC agreed that the obvious 
merits of this outweighed the risks.

Q: How to deal with, from a standpoint of DCMI process, documents that are 
dependant on each other but have different levels of document status. The

[[[ 
DC-EC, Please read this very carefully.... Rael's work on a procedure
for supporting the RSS activity I believe is directly applicable to
DCMI as a whole. I would very much like to consider the dc-ec drafting
a similar (if not identical) model and submitting it to the dc-ac and
dc progress groups for consideration and ratification. --eric

Subject: [RSS-DEV] Procedures 

Howdy, 

In response to some of the calls on RSS-DEV for some procedures, I've 
drafted the following proposal. 

I look forward to discussing this together, figuring out what needs 
tweaking, and coming up with a system that balances open involvement and the 
ability to get things done. 

As I've mentioned at the end of the proposal, the adoption of a process will 
necessarily require a little bootstrapping -- a nice test of the process 
itself. 

Rael 

##### 

RSS-DEV Procedures Proposal 
=========================== 

Motion 
------ 

This is a motion for policy and procedures to be adopted by the RSS-DEV 
mailing list, rss-dev@egroups.com[1]. 

The proposal draws from various sources, including the Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF)[2], Robert's Rules of Order[3], and informal observation of 
similar endeavours. 

Assumptions 
----------- 

1. This process should be open. 

2. This process should allow for both on- and off-topic discussion by group 
   members, regardless of their level of expertise. 

3. This process should allow contribution by any group member, regardless of 
   their level of expertise. 

4. This process should recognise differing levels of commitment and 
   involvement by group members. 

5. There should be a clear process in place for moving from proposal and 
   discussion of modifications to their adoption and incorporation. 

Charter 
------- 

The RSS-DEV Mailing List ("RSS-DEV") is for the discussion and further 
development of the proposed RSS 1.0 specification[4]. 

RSS-DEV is: 

* Open - anyone can join without need of approval 

* Unmoderated -- any member may post without need of post approval 

* Public -- the message archives, documents, links, and other associated 
  facilities are publicly viewable. 

Organisation 
------------ 

RSS-DEV is structured as follows: 

* Interest Group ("IG") -- all mailing list members 

  o may join and leave at will 

  o may discuss any matter within the limits of the RSS-DEV charter 

  o may propose changes to the RSS-DEV charter, "working code" RSS 1.0 
    specification, and modules (including adoption of a module as a 
    "Standard Module) 

  o may second proposals 

  o may call for a poll 

  o may second a call for a poll 

* Working Group ("WG") 

  o are IG members, with consummate rights and privileges 

  o are nominated and voted in by the current WG 

  o may leave at will 

  o may establish a poll 

  o may call for a vote 

  o may second a call for a vote 

  o may establish a vote 

  o may vote 

Procedures for Motions 
---------------------- 

The procedure for a motion is as follows: 

1. A member proposes a motion. 

2. The motion must be seconded ("I second the motion put forth in {URL}"). 
   Failure of a second results in the motion being dropped. 

3. The motion is registered by a WG member as a link to the motion message 
   under http://www.egroups.com/links/rss-dev/Motions/. 

4. Discussion takes place. 

5. A poll may be taken at any point to determine rough consensus. 

   5.1. A member may call for a poll; members are asked to allow 
        (subjectively) for the conversation to die down before calling for a 
        poll to give discussion a chance. 

   5.2. A member seconds the call for a poll a minimum of 1 business day 
        following the poll call to allow for discussion of poll wording. 
        Failure of a second within 5 business days results in the poll call 
        being dropped. 

   5.3. A poll is established by a WG member and left open for 2 business 
        days, during which time all members may participate. 

        Note: A poll must always include an "I Abstain" option. 

   5.4. The poll is concluded by a WG member and results emailed to all 
         members. 

6. A vote may be called at any point to ratify or reject the proposal. 

   6.1. A WG member may call for a vote at any time; as with polls, Working 
        Group members are asked to allow (subjectively) for the conversation 
        to die down before calling for a vote to give discussion a chance. 

   6.2. A WG member seconds a call for a vote. Failure of a second by a WG 
        member results in the vote call being dropped. 

   6.3. A vote is established by a WG member and left open for a minimum of 
        2 business days, after-which it may be concluded at the discretion 
        of the WG chair. 

        Note: A vote must always include an "I Abstain" option. 
   
   6.4. The vote is concluded by the WG chair and results emailed to all 
        members. 

   6.5. Motions must be passed by a 2/3 majority of voters. 

        If passed, the changes are made to the charter, specification, 
        module (including adoption of a module as a "Standard Module"), or 
        WG roster. 

        If not passed, the motion is dropped. Dropped motions may be 
        re-proposed at any time by any member; members are asked to modify 
        the motion as appropriate before re-proposing. 

Initial Working Group ("WG") Members 
------------------------------------ 

The initial Working Group members shall consist of the original RSS 1.0 
Specification proposal[4] authors, namely: 

* Gabe Beged-Dov 
* Dan Brickley 
* Rael Dornfest 
* Ian Davis 
* Leigh Dodds 
* Jonathan Eisenzopf 
* David Galbraith 
* R.V. Guha 
* Eric Miller 
* Eric van der Vlist 

The Working Group chair shall elected by the Working Group members upon the 
adoption of this process. 

Off-Topic / Out-of-Band Discussions 
----------------------------------- 

Off-topic or out of band discussions should adopt the convention of 
prefixing the email subject with [OT]. This allows for free and open 
discussion while affording uninterested members to filter out said threads. 

Process Adoption 
---------------- 

Adoption of this proposal for RSS-DEV policy and procedures will rely upon a 
level of bootstrapping, using the process itself to put it into place.
