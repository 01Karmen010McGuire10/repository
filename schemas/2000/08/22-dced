<!-- note: it is not clear at this time how to address the issue of
incorporating additional vocabularies (such as IEEE, etc.) that have
*not* been officially declared in RDF by the respective standards
organizations. I think perhaps, we will have to additionally declare
these vocabularies and simply assert in human-readable prose their
relationships. -->
