<!-- Class declaration -->

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Resource">
  <rdfs:label>Resource</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A general class of describable resources.</rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource = "http://www.loc.gov/marc/dc/typequalif-19991210.html" />
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&rdfsns;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Collection">
  <rdfs:label>Collection</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A collection is an aggregation of items. The term collection
    means that the resource is described as a group; its parts may be 
    separately described and navigated.</rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
<rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Dataset">
  <rdfs:label>Dataset</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A dataset is information encoded in a defined structure (for 
example, lists, tables, and databases), intended to be useful for direct 
machine processing. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Event">
  <rdfs:label>Event</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>An event is a non-persistent, time-based
occurrence. Metadata for an event provides descriptive information
that is the basis for discovery of the purpose, location, duration,
responsible agents, and links to related events and resources. The
resource of type event may not be retrievable if the described
instantiation has expired or is yet to occur.  Examples - exhibition,
web-cast, conference, workshop, open-day, performance, battle, trial,
wedding, tea-party, conflagration.  </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Image">
  <rdfs:label>Image</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>An image is a primarily symbolic visual representation
other than text. For example - images and photographs of physical
objects, paintings, prints, drawings, other images and graphics,
animations and moving pictures, film, diagrams, maps, musical
notation. Note that image may include both electronic and physical
representations.</rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;InteractiveResource">
  <rdfs:label>Interactive Resource</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>An interactive resource is a resource which requires
interaction from the user to be understood, executed, or
experienced. For example - forms on web pages, applets, multimedia
learning objects, chat services, virtual reality. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Service">
  <rdfs:label>Service</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A service is a system that provides one or more
functions of value to the end-user. Examples include: a photocopying
service, a banking service, an authentication service, interlibrary
loans, a Z39.50 or Web server. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Software">
  <rdfs:label>Software</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>a computer program in source or compiled form which
may be available for installation non-transiently on another
machine. For software which exists only to create an interactive
environment, use interactive instead. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Sound">
  <rdfs:label>Sound</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A sound is a resource whose content is primarily intended to be 
rendered as audio. For example - a music playback file format, an audio 
compact disc, and recorded speech or sounds. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
</rdfs:Class>

<rdfs:Class rdf:about = "&dctypens;Text">
  <rdfs:label>Text</rdfs:label>
  <rdfs:comment>A text is a resource whose content is primarily words
for reading. For example - books, letters, dissertations, poems,
newspapers, articles, archives of mailing lists.  Note that facsimiles
or images of texts are still of the genre text. </rdfs:comment>
  <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource = "&dctypens;Resource" />
  <rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource = "&dctypens;" />
