Joint NISO/DCMI Webinar: Dublin Core: The Road from Metadata Formats to
Linked Data
 
The National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative (DCMI) are pleased to announce a new educational
partnership, starting with a webinar on "Dublin Core: The Road from Metadata
Formats to Linked Data," to be held Wednesday, August 25th, from 1:00 - 2:30
p.m. (eastern time).
 
Created in 1995, the Dublin Core was a result of the early phase of the web
revolution. While most saw the Dublin Core as a simple metadata format, or
as a set of descriptive headers embedded in web pages, a few of its founders
saw it as a cornerstone of a fundamentally new approach to metadata. In the
shadow of search engines, a Semantic Web approach developed in the early
2000s, reaching maturity in 2006 with the Linked Data movement, which uses
Dublin Core as one of its key vocabularies. 
 
This webinar will discuss the difference between traditional approaches
based on record formats and the Linked Data approach, based on metadata
"statements" designed to be merged across data silo boundaries. Focusing on
the dual role of Dublin Core as a format and as a Semantic Web vocabulary,
this webinar will discuss new technologies for bridging the gap between
traditional and Linked Data approaches, highlighting how old ideas such as
embedded metadata have been reinvented with new web technologies and tools
to solve practical problems of resource discovery and navigation.
 
Speakers and topics are:
 
*	Dublin Core in the Early Web Revolution
    Makx Dekkers, Managing Director and CEO, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
    Ltd. (DCMI)

    Makx will describe how the early history of the Dublin Core illustrates an
    emerging split between two quite different paradigms for metadata -- one
    based on closed systems and record formats and the other based on
    recombinational metadata with an "open-world" assumption.
 
*	What Makes the Linked Data Approach Different
    Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer, DCMI Ltd.

    Tom will demonstrate how metadata can be designed for merging across the
    boundaries of repositories and data silos.
 
*	Designing Interoperable Metadata on Linked Data Principles
    Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer, DCMI Ltd. 

    Tom will show how good metadata design is rooted in well-articulated
    requirements and how the interoperability of metadata depends on shared
    underlying vocabularies in the context of a shared "grammar" for metadata.
 
*	Bridging the Gap to the Linked Data Cloud
    Makx Dekkers, Managing Director and CEO, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
    Ltd. (DCMI)

    Makx will describe how existing metadata applications can participate in the
    Linked Data cloud with emphasis on the role of simple, generic vocabularies
    such as the Dublin Core in providing a common denominator for
    interoperability.
