            <p><strong>2000-08-03: New Tool -
            DC-assist</strong></p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcassist/">DC-assist</a>
            is a small, flexible help utility for metadata
            applications and is intended to complement the help
            pages embedded within existing software. Start
            DC-assist up once at the beginning of your session for
            quick and easy access to a set of help pages that
            provide:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>element and qualifier definitions,</li>

              <li>comments,</li>

              <li>data entry guidelines (not yet available),</li>

              <li>examples,</li>

              <li>links to further information.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>DC-assist can be configured for local use using a
            configuration file. In the future, it will be enhanced
            so that as much information as possible will be
            extracted from an 'application profile' stored in a
            metadata registry (such as the one being developed by
            the <a href="http://www.schemas-forum.org/">SCHEMAS
            project</a>), directly from RDF schema definition
            files, or from some combination of both.</p>

            <p>The default DC-assist configuration is based on the
            elements defined in the 'Dublin Core Metadata Element
            Set, Version 1.1: Reference Description' and the
            qualifiers defined in the 'Dublin Core Qualifiers'.
            This configuration also contains around 100 examples
            (mainly taken from RFC-2731).</p>

<p><strong>2000-07-12: New Project: The Victorian Education Channel</strong></p>

            <p>Home Page: <a
            href="http://www.education.vic.gov.au/">http://www.education.vic.gov.au/</a>
            (Site is still under development)</p>

            <p>The Victorian Education Channel (an educational
            gateway for the State of Victoria, Australia) has been
            developed to integrate access to educational
            information and services available on the web. In
            particular, it provides integrated access to resources
            from the Department of Education, Employment and
            Training (DEET), Victoria and associated providers. It
            also supports discovery of other resources pertinent to
            Victorian education. The Channel is for teachers,
            students, parents and the community - anyone requiring
            information with an educational focus - and covers all
            sectors of education from early school to tertiary and
            vocational.</p>

            <p>The Victorian Education Channel uses the standard 15
            Dublin Core (DC) elements and 'audience' as an extra
            element (as recommended by the DC-Education Working
            Group). All elements have qualifiers, are expressed in
            RDF, and many have controlled vocabularies or
            recommended formats. Elements can be repeated and are
            not mandatory although for national interoperability, a
            minimal set is required. The DC classification is
            backed up by a full text indexing capability. DC
            records are created using a 'workbench' that combines
            original authoring or metadata with harvesting of
            pre-existing metadata, in HTML or RDF. The workbench
            also 'putates' values that the author can choose to
            ratify. The records are searched by default or
            user-structured searches or browsed.</p>

            <p>Searches are complemented by access to the full-text
            indexes. Dewey DC has been included as a global
            taxonomy to complement the more locally-relevant
            taxonomies but it is not expected that all resources
            will be classified using this facility.</p>

            <p>DEET has been actively classifying resources for
            several years so the channel is being populated by a
            combination of imported, existing records and newly
            created records. The channel will be supported by
            resource authoring, and other systems, that either
            contribute to the generation of classification records
            or use the information in the records as data for
            user-specific applications.</p>

<p><strong>2000-06-25: Tool Upgrade: DC-dot now provides support for the W3C XHTML 
1.0 Recommendation</strong></p>

            <p><a
            href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/dcdot/">DC-dot,</a>
            UKOLN's web-based Dublin Core generator and editor now
            provides support for the W3C XHTML 1.0
            recommendation.</p>

            <p>To use this feature, create your DC metadata in the
            normal way. Then choose 'XHTML' from the 'Display
            format' pull down menu.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</a>
            became a W3C Recommendation on 26 January 2000. It is a
            reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML, bringing the rigor
            of XML to HTML, and can be put to immediate use with
            existing browsers by following a few simple
            guidelines.</p>

            <p>The key differences between &lt;meta&gt; elements in
            XHTML and HTML 4 are that:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>element names must be in lower-case -
              &lt;meta&gt; rather than &lt;META&gt;</li>

              <li>empty elements (for example, &lt;meta&gt; and
              &lt;link&gt;) must end with '/&gt;'</li>

<p><strong>2000-06-10: New Tool: Online Dublin Core Extraction Service</strong></p>

            href="http://www.w3.org/2000/06/dc-extract/form.html">online
            Dublin Core Extraction Service</a>, which uses XSLT to
            extract RDF Dublin Core metadata from XHTML pages. The
            default transformation for this form, dc-extract.xsl,
            converts from the format given in "<a
            href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2731.txt">Encoding
            Dublin Core Metadata in HTML</a>" by John Kunze and

<p><strong>2000-02-10: New Project: Foundations Project</strong></p>

            <p>The <a
            href="http://bridges.state.mn.us/">Foundations
            Project</a> is a State of Minnesota multi-agency
            collaborative project aimed at improving public access
            to environmental and natural resources data and
            information. The focus of the Project is on developing
            intuitive and easy to use search tools and strategies.
            Staff and agency participants catalog many kinds of
            electronic information resources using qualified Dublin
            Core elements. These resources can be used to develop
            advanced search and retrieval techniques that integrate
            access to this information across agency Web sites. The
            search interface is called <a
            href="http://bridges.state.mn.us/">Bridges</a>,
            signifying the metaphorical spanning of information
            across Minnesota state agencies. Based on project
            research findings and using principles of information
            architecture, a "blueprint" specifying best practices
            for Minnesota state environmental Web sites is being
            created. As the Foundations Project nears completion,
            efforts are in place to bring the successes and
            blueprint to the remaining state agencies. For more
            information, please contact <a

<p><strong>2000-02-03: Dublin Core version 1.1 approved as a CEN Workshop Agreement 
(CWA)</strong></p>

            <p>At last week's meeting of the CEN/ISSS Workshop on
            Metadata for Multimedia Information - Dublin Core
            (MMI-DC), approval in unison was given for Dublin Core
            version 1.1 as a CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA). It will
            be published with a foreword and with some formal
            changes of the references in DC 1.1.</p>

            <p>The workshop now continues the work with Guidance
            Information for the use of Dublin Core in Europe. The
            Guidance material is intended to bring together
            documentation on the use of Dublin Core in Europe in
            the following areas:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Strategic documentation (i.e.: outlining the
              reasons for choosing Dublin Core or another Metadata
              Element Set).</li>

              <li>User guidelines.</li>

              <li>Technical implementation guidelines</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In parallel with this activity, is a task for the
            workshop to maintain and promote a knowledge base for
            metadata for multimedia information (the "Observatory")
            to continually assess relationships between Dublin Core
            and other initiatives - in order to assist evolution of
            standardised metadata schemes. This knowledge base
            identifies the key activities currently being
            undertaken in Europe and across the world - the scope
            of these activities and related work in European
            projects and programs.</p>

            Science Council</a>), we are developing metadata for
            various kinds of objects (historical records, cultural
            objects, paintings, maps, photos, butterfly, etc.), and

<p><strong>2000-01-24: New Project: Te Kete Ipurangi - the Online Learning Centre</strong></p>

            <p>This national site, an initiative of New Zealand's
            Ministry of Education, is being developed and managed
            by <a
            href="http://www.tki.org.nz/about/aboutabout.php3">The
            Learning Centre Trust</a> to support the growing online
            education community in New Zealand.</p>

            <p>The current online version is phase 1 of a two phase
            project. The second phase will see the site re-launch
            early in 2000 as a bilingual education portal+ site
            which will provide visitors with both quality-assured
            content and links to evaluated online education
            resources. The site will continue to be developed and
            expanded by the Trust over the next two years and the
            site invites contributions from the New Zealand and
            global education communities.</p>

            <p>The Trust is currently in the process of developing
            a National Education Standard which will define a
            Dublin Core education set and an education metadata set
            for TKI. The Trust hopes that this will be developed in
            collaboration with the Department of Education,
            Victoria, Australia so that an Australasian set can be
            explored. The Trust plans to make available to authors
            of other New Zealand education sites, tools which will
            assist them to apply the agreed Education Standards to
            the content they produce.</p>
