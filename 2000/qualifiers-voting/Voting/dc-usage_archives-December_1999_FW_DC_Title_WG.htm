Title WG <BR>MIME-Version: 1.0 <BR>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" 
<BR>
<P>Dear All, <BR>
<P>due to complete destruction of my hard disk over two weeks ago, I have had 
<BR>problems keeping up with the email and deadlines imposed on the working 
<BR>groups. Tomorrow, I will (presumably) have access to my original data, 
<BR>including the recommendations of the DC.Title working Group which were to 
<BR>go up on the web after DC 7. This information was sent to the DC.title 
<BR>working group members after the DC 7 and to the dc-general list. I have now 
<BR>received several more responses and will send the final review page to Beth 
<BR>Marsh by Thursday (presuming I get to my former data). <BR>
<P>The basic gist of the review procedure was that DC.Title.Alternative was 
<BR>the only approved qualifier for the DC Element set. Audience and release 
<BR>were relegated to discussion in the Subject/Description and DC.Education 
<BR>Working Groups. <BR>
<P>I apologize for the delays, but beg for understanding that this computer 
<BR>damage really made work difficult for me and I am still picking up the 
<BR>pieces of work undone due to this situation. My institute didn't even have 
<BR>a substitute machine to use while the computer is being repaired, and 
<BR>picking up my emails with my laptop from home proved to bring new problems 
<BR>to solve (which hopefully are also now over). <BR>
<P>Thanks, Tom, for your call - wishing you all a blessed Christmas or other 
<BR>holiday at the year's end and a good start for the New Year (with as few 
<BR>computer problems as is possible!) <BR>
<P>Diann <BR>
