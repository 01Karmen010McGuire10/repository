<H3>Proposed Subject, Description and Language Qualifiers </H3>
<H4>Date: 1999-12-20</H4>

<HR>
This report proposes a set of core qualifiers for the DC Subject, Description 
and Language element. 
<P><B>Note</B>: The appearance of a qualifier in this list should <B>not</B> be 
taken as an endorsement of its use by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative at 
this time.

  <P>Existing resource discovery implementations treat classification notation 
  (codes) differently to 'words' describing subject. Typically notation is used 
  to create a browsing structure whereas words are not, notation is not 
  displayed in retrieved lists whereas 'subject words' are displayed. </P>
  <P>It is important for software to precisely recognise notations as different 
  from 'subject words'. Looking for numeric strings cannot be relied on as 
  notations may be alphanumeric so it is useful to identify them by means of a 
  qualifier. </P>
  <P>It is unrealistic to expect software to identify notations as such by means 
  of the value qualifier for subject, as there is a potentially huge list of 
  value qualifiers which cover subject headings, and thesauri as well as 
  classification notations. </P>Examples include: <BR>DC.Subject.Classification 
  = 301.12 <BR>DC.Subject.Classification = SfB Uhj <BR>DC.Subject.Classification 
  = 301:624(England)<BR>

  <BR>Identification of the controlled vocabulary from which the subject values 
  are taken enables manipulation of the values to enhance effectiveness of 
  retrieval. <BR>For Subject value qualifiers, only a core list has been 
  enumerated. These represent schemes that are of general use. Of course there 
  are many more schemes that are being used in implementations and many more 
  schemes that might be used in future. At some stage it would be helpful for 
  implementations to be given the means to register schemes in use in order to 
  share information about deployment. This is seen as a different activity to 
  defining key qualifiers. <BR>

  <BR>yes (although there is some disagreement on this. Some argue that 
  "Release" doesn't refine Description, Description being defined as "an account 
  of the content of a resource", but others say that Release *does* tell you 
  something about the content of a resource more specifically than it tells you 
  something about the Title of a resource. For example, the 4th edition of a 
  book may well have a different title from the 3rd edition - "edition" says 
  something about the content, not the title per se. <BR>see Cliff Morgan's mail

  <BR>no 
  <LI><I>identify potential overlap/conflicts with other qualifiers if 
  applicable (optional)</I> <BR>There is a possible overlap with Release being 
  used as a value component of the TITLE element. The Citation and Title WG's 
  recommended to the Subdesc WG that Release be included as a proposed qualifier 
  for DESCRIPTION. In a spirit of co-operation we have included this. Much of 
  the justification for this recommendation is that qualifying TITLE with 
  Release breaks the 'dumb down' rule. The possibility of identifying Release as 
  a value component of the TITLE value, and therefore circumventing 'dumb-down' 
  and 'refinement' criteria was not discussed. </LI></UL>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>There has been some discussion within the dc-subdesc list as to whether 
  'audience' sould be introduced as a qualifier to Description. This proposal 
  has been withdrawn as discussion has now moved to the dc-education list. 
  <LI>The use of descriptor and keyword qualifiers were considered redundant by 
  consensus of the WG. For reasons of caution these have not gone forward into 
  the final proposal. Use of a controlled voacabulary (descriptor) will be 
  indicated by the presence of a value qualifier. </LI></OL>
