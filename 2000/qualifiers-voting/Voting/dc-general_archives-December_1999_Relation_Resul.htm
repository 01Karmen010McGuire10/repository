<P>Dear Readers: <BR>
<P>Here is the tally of votes with the following notes: <BR>
<P>* The typographical error in 12 &amp; 14 has been corrected. <BR>
<P>* The following did not receive a majority of positive votes [number of 
<BR>votes for/against shown in brackets]: <BR>
<P>15 &amp; 16 Continues [5/8]&amp; Definition [5/8] <BR>17 &amp; 18 Is 
ContinuedBy [5/8] &amp; Definition [5/8] <BR>23 &amp; 24 OtherFormat [3/10] 
&amp; Definition [3/10] <BR>
<P>* While receiving a majority of votes, the following do not seem to 
<BR>represent a consensus: <BR>
<P>22 Definition of HasFormat [7/6] <BR>29 &amp; 30 IsBasedOn [7/6] &amp; 
Definition [7/6] <BR>31 &amp; 32 IsBasisFor [7/6] &amp; Definition [7/6] <BR>
<P>Given that # 19, IsFormatOf [10/3], and # 21, HasFormat [9/3] received 
<BR>majority positive votes, it would seem that we must modify the definition 
<BR>[7/6] of HasFormat. <BR>
<P>IsBasedOn and IsBasisFor seem to need more discussion. Conflict with Source 
<BR>was noted. <BR>
<P>Comments or suggestions? <BR>
