                          (Site is still under development)</p>

                          <p>The Victorian Education Channel (an
                          educational gateway for the State of
                          Victoria, Australia) has been developed
                          to integrate access to educational
                          information and services available on the
                          web. In particular, it provides
                          integrated access to resources from the
                          Department of Education, Employment and
                          Training (DEET), Victoria and associated
                          providers. It also supports discovery of
                          other resources pertinent to Victorian
                          education. The Channel is for teachers,
                          students, parents and the community -
                          anyone requiring information with an
                          educational focus - and covers all
                          sectors of education from early school to
                          tertiary and vocational.</p>

                          <p>The Victorian Education Channel uses
                          the standard 15 Dublin Core (DC) elements
                          and 'audience' as an extra element (as
                          recommended by the DC-Education Working
                          Group). All elements have qualifiers, are
                          expressed in RDF, and many have
                          controlled vocabularies or recommended
                          formats. Elements can be repeated and are
                          not mandatory although for national
                          interoperability, a minimal set is
                          required. The DC classification is backed
                          up by a full text indexing capability. DC
                          records are created using a 'workbench'
                          that combines original authoring or
                          metadata with harvesting of pre-existing
                          metadata, in HTML or RDF. The workbench
                          also 'putates' values that the author can
                          choose to ratify. The records are
                          searched by default or user-structured

                          <p>Searches are complemented by access to
                          the full-text indexes. Dewey DC has been
                          included as a global taxonomy to
                          complement the more locally-relevant
                          taxonomies but it is not expected that
                          all resources will be classified using
                          this facility.</p>

                          <p>DEET has been actively classifying
                          resources for several years so the
                          channel is being populated by a
                          combination of imported, existing records
                          and newly created records. The channel
                          will be supported by resource authoring,
                          and other systems, that either contribute
                          to the generation of classification
                          records or use the information in the
                          records as data for user-specific
                          applications.</p>
