<p><strong>2000-04-17: Approved Dublin Core
                  Interoperability Qualifiers
                  Announced</strong></p>
<p>The DC-Usage Committee has completed balloting
                  of the initial round of proposed <a
                  href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-general/2000-04/0010.html">
                  Dublin Core Interoperability Qualifiers</a>.
                  These qualifiers are intended to promote
                  interoperability among applications that use
                  element refinements and encoding schemes to
                  increase the semantic precision of metadata.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of
                  Qualification</strong></p>
<p>In judging the suitability of proposed
                  qualifiers, the DC Usage Committee recognized two
                  basic categories of qualifiers. It is expected
                  that these categories will aid application
                  designers in developing coherent local qualifiers
                  as well.</p>
<p>1. Encoding Schemes</p>
<p>These qualifiers are pointers to schemes that
                  aid in the interpretation of an element value.
                  These schemes include controlled vocabularies and
                  formal notations. A value expressed using an
                  Encoding Scheme will thus be a token selected
                  from a vocabulary (e.g., a term from a
                  classification system or set of subject headings)
                  or a string formatted in accordance with a
                  notation (e.g., "2000-01-01" as the standard
                  expression of a date).</p>
<p>2. Element Refinements</p>
<p>These qualifiers make an element's meaning
                  more specific without extending its meaning. A
                  refined element shares the meaning of the
                  unqualified element, but with a more restricted
                  scope.</p>
<p>Local versus interoperability qualifiers</p>
<p>Application designers should keep in mind that
                  the present set of qualifiers is not intended to
                  satisfy all applications, and that meeting local
                  functional requirements with additional local
                  elements and qualifiers is expected. It is
                  expected that as local qualifiers are
                  demonstrated to be of broader use that they will
                  attract wider deployment and be considered for
                  adoption as DC Interoperability Qualifiers.</p>
<p>Syntactic Encodings</p>
<p>The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative will issue
                  recommendations in the near future about
                  syntactic encoding of approved qualified Dublin
                  Core in HTML, XML, and RDF.</p>
<p><strong>The DC Usage Committee</strong></p>
<p>The DC Usage Committee is a subset of the DC
                  Advisory Committee. Its membership, listed below,
                  includes representation of librarians, museum
                  informatics, digital library researchers, the
                  instructional metadata community, and system
                  implementers from 8 countries on 4 continents.
                  These individuals have invested countless hours
                  since the Frankfurt metadata conference in a
                  difficult, often contentious task. Many thanks
                  are due them for their efforts.</p>

                  three new venues for its workshop: Helping People
                  Find What They Want: Implementing the Dublin Core
                  in Museums</strong> 

                  
<p>This two day workshop focuses on information
                  access and management issues in museums and
                  cultural heritage organizations through the use
                  of the CIMI recommendations for the Dublin Core
                  metadata standard. This workshop is designed for
                  museum and cultural heritage professionals,
                  information managers, systems staff, and
                  administrators looking for ways to better manage
                  information resources and make them available to
                  the broad World Wide Web audience. Technical
                  expertise is not required.</p>
