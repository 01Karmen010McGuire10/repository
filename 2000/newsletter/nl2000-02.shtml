                    <strong>Dublin Core version 1.1 approved as a
                    CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA)</strong>
                  </div>
<p align="left">At last week's meeting of the
                  CEN/ISSS Workshop on Metadata for Multimedia
                  Information - Dublin Core (MMI-DC), approval in
                  unison was given for Dublin Core version 1.1 as a
                  CEN Workshop Agreement (CWA). It will be
                  published with a foreword and with some formal
                  changes of the references in DC 1.1.</p>
<p align="left">The workshop now continues the
                  work with Guidance Information for the use of
                  Dublin Core in Europe. The Guidance material is
                  intended to bring together documentation on the
                  use of Dublin Core in Europe in the following
                  areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
                   Strategic documentation (i.e.: outlining
                  the reasons for choosing Dublin Core or another
                  Metadata Element Set);</li>
<li>User guidelines;</li>
<li>Technical implementation guidelines;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In parallel with this activity,
                  is a task for the workshop to maintain and
                  promote a knowledge base for metadata for
                  multimedia information (the "Observatory") to
                  continually assess relationships between Dublin
                  Core and other initiatives - in order to assist
                  evolution of standardised metadata schemes. This
                  knowledge base identifies the key activities
                  currently being undertaken in Europe and across
                  the world - the scope of these activities and
                  related work in European projects and
                  programs.</p>

                announces a face-to-face meeting in Australia,
                19-20 February 2000 The DC-Education working group
                will be holding its face-to-face meeting in
                Melbourne, Australia on the weekend of February
                19-20, 2000. From this meeting, a draft proposal
                will emerge for possible education-related
                qualifiers for the Dublin core elements and
                possible additional elements and qualifiers, if
                necessary. [<a

                  Centre</strong></p>
<p>This national site, an initiative of New
                  Zealand's Ministry of Education, is being
                  developed and managed by <a
                  href="http://www.tki.org.nz/about/aboutabout.php3">
                  The Learning Centre Trust</a> to support the
                  growing online education community in New
                  Zealand.</p>
<p>The current online version is phase 1 of a two
                  phase project. The second phase will see the site
                  re-launch early in 2000 as a bilingual education
                  portal+ site which will provide visitors with
                  both quality-assured content and links to
                  evaluated online education resources. The site
                  will continue to be developed and expanded by the
                  Trust over the next two years and the site
                  invites contributions from the New Zealand and
                  global education communities.</p>
<p>The Trust is currently in the process of
                  developing a National Education Standard which
                  will define a Dublin Core education set and an
                  education metadata set for TKI. The Trust hopes
                  that this will be developed in collaboration with
                  the Department of Education, Victoria, Australia
                  so that an Australasian set can be explored. The
                  Trust plans to make available to authors of other
                  New Zealand education sites, tools which will
                  assist them to apply the agreed Education
                  Standards to the content they produce.</p>

                 ELT is a framework for building multi-lingual
                search services cooperating in a network and
                providing useful resource discovery for quality
                assessed Internet sources. The project is producing
                a tool kit and methodologies for building databases
                containing metadata for quality assessed resources.
                The tools are meant to fulfill the needs of
                providers of search services in the European school
                sector. A prototype service is provided as a proof
                of concept. The resources are described using
                metadata. The descriptions will be produced by
                editorial staff (mainly teachers) in Europe.
