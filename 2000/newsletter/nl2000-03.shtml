                  three new venues for its workshop: Helping People
                  Find What They Want: Implementing the Dublin Core
                  in Museums</strong> 

                  
<p>This two day workshop focuses on information
                  access and management issues in museums and
                  cultural heritage organizations through the use
                  of the CIMI recommendations for the Dublin Core
                  metadata standard. This workshop is designed for
                  museum and cultural heritage professionals,
                  information managers, systems staff, and
                  administrators looking for ways to better manage
                  information resources and make them available to
                  the broad World Wide Web audience. Technical
                  expertise is not required.</p>

                  <strong>DC-Education: F2F Downunder, February
                  19-20, 2000</strong> 

                  
<p>The meeting of the DC-Education Working Group
                  in Australia in February was a successful first
                  venture into the realm of domain specific
                  enhancements to the basic Dublin Core element
                  set. Thirty participants gathered in a rustic
                  lodge setting in the hills outside of Melbourne,
                  Australia to extend discussions begun at DC-7 in
                  Frankfurt, Germany. The report and
                  recommendations from the meeting will soon be
                  available for review and discussion. Highlights
                  include proposals for encoding the intended
                  audience of the resource as well as indications
                  of conformance of the resource to formal
                  standards. Various deployment alternatives were
                  proposed for further discussion in the broader
                  community. Other important discussion issues
                  included questions of mixing and matching
                  metadata from related sets, and how the community
                  should address controversial topics such as
                  measures of quality and descriptions of pedagogy.
                  These are desirable retrieval characteristics for
                  some communities, but are fraught with
                  ideological judgments that complicate the
                  creation of interoperable metadata. The report
                  will be discussed on the <a href="http://www.mailbase.ac.uk/lists/dc-education/">DC-Education list</a>  and will be posted to DC-General in the near
                  future.

                  <strong>Project Summary:</strong> Foundation
                  Project (submitted by <a
                  href="mailto:eileen.quam@dnr.state.mn.us">Eileen
                  Quam</a>) 

                  
<p>The Foundations Project is a State of
                  Minnesota multi-agency collaborative project
                  aimed at improving public access to environmental
                  and natural resources data and information. The
                  focus of the Project is on developing intuitive
                  and easy to use search tools and strategies.
                  Staff and agency participants catalog many kinds
                  of electronic information resources using
                  qualified Dublin Core elements. These resources
                  can be used to develop advanced search and
                  retrieval techniques that integrate access to
                  this information across agency Web sites. The
                  search interface is called Bridges
                  (http://bridges.state.mn.us), signifying the
                  metaphorical spanning of information across
                  Minnesota state agencies. Based on project
                  research findings and using principles of
                  information architecture, a "blueprint"
                  specifying best practices for Minnesota state
                  environmental agency Web sites is being created.
                  As the Foundations Project nears completion,
                  efforts are in place to bring the successes and
                  blueprint to the remaining state agencies.</p>
<p>In summary, the project is working on:</p>
<ul>
                    
<li>Consumer-oriented needs for environmental
                    information and data maintained or made
                    available through Minnesota state agencies</li>
<li>An approach that will provide integrated
                    access to environmental information and data
                    consistent with emerging technology standards,
                    guidelines and best practices, including
                    qualified Dublin Core, controlled vocabulary,
                    and standardized application of metadata</li>
<li>Evaluating the approach's effectiveness for
                    integrated access, using external reviewers who
                    represent a wide range of public points of
                    view</li>
<li>Designing, evaluating and expediting
                    guidelines for documentation, thesaurus and
                    metadata implementation, which promotes
                    responsive search and retrieval procedures</li>
<li>Providing skilled assistance to state
                    agencies that catalog environmental
                    information</li>
<li>Preparing a workable blueprint to improve
                    discovery and retrieval of environmental
                    information resources, based on research and
                    testing throughout the project</li>
<li>Conducting outreach to inform key user
                    groups and promote implementation of the
                    blueprint throughout state government.</li>
