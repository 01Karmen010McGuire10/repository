[Design Linked Data Workshop](http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/index/pages/view/workshop) section

Full Day Workshop

Do you have resources you want to publish on the Web? Don't know where you should begin or how those resources should or can be described?

Working in groups with common interests, workshop participants will engage in
hands-on activities developing an application profile (AP). We invite
participants to bring their own real world problems in order to ground the
activities of the workshop in practical ways. By the end of the workshop,
participants will understand the concept of AP, the processes used in their
development, and their importance to the Linked Open Data ecosystem.
Participants will engage in hands-on activities developing an application
profile. Groups will be comprised of people with comment interests or context
of application.

An AP is a kind of schema and documentation that: (a) defines metadata records,
(b) describes the structure and the content of those records, (c) defines which
properties will be used from existing schemas and those you need to create, and
(d) teaches you how optimized the result for your application domain.
application profiles are a central construct in developing semantically
interoperable metadata for the Web and understanding the processes in their
development is central to creating metadata that speaks the language of the
Linked Open Data ecosystem.
